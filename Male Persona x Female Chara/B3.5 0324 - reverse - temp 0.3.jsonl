It was hot and heavy in his palm, leaking against his knuckles.

God help him, he did.\n\nThe stretch burned when she pushed inside, her cock splitting him open in one brutal thrust. Nuka sobbed into the sheets, back bowing as she bottomed out. Gina's groan was guttural, her teeth sinking into his shoulder to muffle it. \"*Mein Gott*... so *tight*—\"\n\nShe didn't give him time to adjust. Her hips snapped forward, each drive punching the air from his lungs. The slap of skin on skin echoed off the cinderblock walls, mingling with their ragged breaths. Nuka could feel the sweat dripping down her spine when he reached back to claw at her ass, urging her deeper. \"*Harder*—!\"\n\nGina snarled, her hand fisting in his hair to wrench his head back. \"You *want* it rough?\" Her thrusts turned erratic, the cot screeching in protest.","The office smelled of gun oil and stale coffee, the dim glow of tactical monitors casting long shadows across scattered mission reports.

Her hips rolled instinctively, taking him deeper as her cunt pulsed around his cock, still sensitive from her last climax. \"You don't—*ah*—*owe* me anything.\"\n\nHer calloused palm cradled his jaw, forcing him to meet her gaze. Blue eyes, sharp even through the liquor haze, searched his face like she was trying to memorize every scar, every shadow.

Her voice was raw, stripped bare. \"*Immer.*\" (*Always.*)\n\nHer hand slid between them, fingers circling her clit with rough, desperate strokes. She was already close again—had been since the moment he'd sunk back into her, since the first time he'd whispered her name like a prayer in this loop.

She bit his lip hard enough to draw fresh blood, her hips stuttering against his.\n\nNuka followed with a broken groan, spilling inside her as she milked him dry.
