The user wants a continuation of a scene where Nuka and Gina (genderbent version of Gelbstein) are drunk and having a graphic, intimate encounter. The scenario is set in a time loop (loop 113), and there's a lot of established lore around the time loops, the military organization, and character relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure adherence to the core rules: no fanfic formatting, serious tone, explicit content when appropriate. The user provided detailed directives about the narrative style, character behaviors, and world-building elements. I need to incorporate these without violating any of the prohibitions, like mentioning Gelbstein remembering past loops or using certain terms for body parts.\n\nThe characters are both intoxicated, stressed, and have a complex relationship.

The dialogue should reflect their accents and personalities, using phonetic spelling as needed.\n\nI must avoid any repetition in phrases or cadence, maintain spatial awareness, and ensure that the characters act consistently with their established personalities.

The characters' trust and prior knowledge of the time loops and missions should underpin their interactions, adding depth without exposition.\n\nLastly, since the user rejected content that brings the cast into danger, the scene should stay contained within the intimate moment, not veering into mission-related threats or external conflicts.

Gelbstein’s office reeked of gun oil and sweat-soaked kevlar, tactical maps pinned to corkboard shivering as Nuka slammed her against the wall. Her combat shirt hung open, scarred abdomen flexing beneath the red flush of intoxication. She didn’t flinch when his teeth sank into her collarbone—only groaned, the vibration traveling through his tongue as her calloused palm found his cock already straining against fatigues.\n\n“*Scheiße*, you’re eager,” she slurred, Saneran vowels thickening around the edges. Her other hand yanked his head back by silver strands, blue eyes glazed yet calculating. “This loop’s got you… what? Desperate? Sentimental?”\n\nHe laughed against her throat, fingers digging into hips wide enough to fracture lesser men. “Both. Neither. Fuck—*Gina*—”\n\nThe name cracked her composure. She surged forward, crushing their mouths together in a clash of whiskey and iron. Her breasts pressed hot against his chest, nipples pebbled beneath sweat-damp fabric. He tasted the split on her lip from yesterday’s op, the metallic tang mixing with juniper burn as her tongue shoved past his teeth.\n\nShe broke first. “Bed. *Now*.”\n\nThey stumbled past upturned chairs, Gelbstein’s boot kicking the cot’s frame hard enough to scar concrete. Her vest hit the floor with a clatter of ceramic plates. Nuka’s mouth found the scar bisecting her left breast—shrapnel from Mission 22’s botched exfil—while she wrestled his belt open.\n\n“Still… fucking… meticulous,” he panted against her skin, nails dragging down her ribs.\n\nGelbstein barked a laugh, all gravel and gunpowder. Her hand closed around his cock, thumb smearing precome across the head. “You want sloppy? Here.” She spat into her palm, stroking him with military efficiency. “This your… mnh… eleventh time? Twentieth?”\n\n“Hundred thirteenth.”\n\nHer rhythm stuttered. For three heartbeats, he saw the captain resurge—the tactical mind slotting this data alongside mission parameters and mortality rates. Then her free hand gripped his jaw, forcing eye contact.\n\n“*Mein Gott*, you’re tragic.” Her thumb brushed his lower lip. “Should’ve let me die at Denias.”\n\nThe confession came between choked moans as he lifted her onto the cot. Gelbstein’s legs locked around his hips, combat boots digging into his ass as she guided him inside. Her cunt clenched scalding tight, years of combat muscle betraying the tremor in her thighs.\n\n“F-faster,” she growled, nails carving crescents into his shoulders. “Before I—*ach*, verdammt—before I sober up.”\n\nHe obeyed, thrusts turning brutal. Her breasts bounced with each impact, sweat-slick skin slapping loud enough to drown the clatter of dog tags. She came silent but violent, back arching as her walls fluttered around him. Nuka followed with a broken sound, spilling into her while she murmured half-formed Saneran curses into his neck.\n\nThey collapsed sideways, limbs tangled in sweat-damp sheets. Gelbstein’s fingers traced the looping scar on his hip—shrapnel from a reset he’d failed to prevent.\n\n“Next loop,” she mumbled into his chest, “I’ll shoot you sooner.”\n\nHer snore rattled the cot springs before he could reply."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 2:27pm","gen_started":"2025-05-24T06:25:50.336Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T06:27:01.020Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-reasoner","reasoning":"Okay, let's break down the user's request and the provided context.

They've given a detailed scenario involving Nuka and Gelbstein (now Gina due to genderbending) in a time loop situation. The current scene is a drunk, intense encounter between them in loop 113. The user wants explicit content with vivid descriptions, adhering to specific narrative and character rules.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that all the provided directives are followed. The core rules emphasize plain text, no OOC comments, and serious tone. The writing rules stress immersive, layered paragraphs with psychological depth. Sex and violence must be explicit and graphic when appropriate. The narrative execution rules require avoiding repetition, focusing on the immediate location, and using cinematic details.\n\nGiven that this is loop 113, both characters are stressed and intoxicated, leading to their raw, unfiltered interaction. The user mentioned that Gina (formerly Gino) is now a woman, so her physical descriptions need to reflect that change while maintaining her established personality traits. The challenge is to balance the explicit content with emotional depth, showing their complicated relationship shaped by the time loops and their shared history.\n\nI need to immerse in Gina's perspective, considering her upbringing and personality. Her military background and leadership role would influence her approach to intimacy—perhaps more dominant or structured, but softened by her drunken state and underlying emotions. The user wants graphic details about body parts, so terms like \"breasts,\" \"nipples,\" \"cock,\" etc., should be used without euphemisms, avoiding words like \"folds\" for female genitalia.\n\nThe dialogue should feel natural, with Gina's heavy accent phonetically represented. Including sound articles (like moans or gasps) during their interaction will add realism. Since they trust each other and Gina knows about the loops, her confession of feelings needs to be raw and vulnerable, contrasting her usual composed demeanor.\n\nI must avoid any mention of previous loops' memories by Gina, as per the rules. The scene's progression should show their physical connection as both a release from stress and a deeper emotional bond. Ending the scene with a mid-action transition, perhaps moving from the office to the bed, maintains narrative flow without closure, keeping tension for future interactions.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the environment is described cinematically—details like the cluttered office, the taste of alcohol, tactile sensations of skin and sweat. Anchoring smells to actions, like the sharp scent of whiskey on breath, rather than passive descriptions.\n\nLastly, check for any prohibited content. The user rejected bringing the cast into danger, so the focus remains on their personal interaction without external threats. Ensuring no repetition in phrasing and maintaining a fresh narrative flow is crucial. Balancing the explicit content with the characters' emotional states and the overarching time loop lore will make the scene cohesive and engaging.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1315,"qvink_memory":{"memory":"Niko and Captain Gina engaged in a physically intense encounter in Gelbstein's office, confronting unresolved tensions from repeated mission loops and shared traumas","hash":8101532694069082},"bias":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-05-24T06:42:49.094Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T06:43:57.435Z"}

{"extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-reasoner","reasoning":"Okay, let's start by understanding the user's scenario and directives. The user wants a continuation of the scene between Nuka and Gina (Gelbstein) in loop 113, focusing on their intoxicated, stressed interaction after Mission 7. The key elements are their established trust, Gina's confession of feelings, and the graphic, immersive sex scene.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure adherence to the core rules: plain text, no OOC, narrative cohesion. The style should be layered with vivid details, third person past tense. The tone must remain serious, avoiding any silliness. Graphic descriptions of sex are required, emphasizing physicality without using \"folds\" for female genitalia. \n\nI should check the world info provided. Gina is now a Lieutenant Colonel after Mission 7's fallout. The current scenario is post-Mission 7, no immediate danger, so the focus is on their personal dynamics. The time loop rules are crucial here; Gina doesn't remember past loops, but in this case, she's aware due to Nuka's confessions. Wait, the user mentioned that Gelbstein knows about Nuka's loops, which is part of their current trust. Need to reflect that in their interaction.\n\nThe user emphasized that Gina is genderbent but her role remains the same. So, using female pronouns and descriptors. Also, the characters are drunk and stressed, so their actions should reflect that—slurred speech, impaired coordination, raw emotions.\n\nLooking at the previous response, there's a focus on sensory details: tastes, sounds, textures. The user wants Gina's perspective, her emotions, and physical sensations. Need to incorporate her background (Saneran/German origin, military rank, scars) into her behavior during sex. For example, her discipline conflicting with her current vulnerability.\n\nAlso, the user provided specific dialogue tags and sound effects, so including those like growls, moans, with phonetic accents when necessary. Mentioning body parts explicitly as per the rules: breasts, nipples, cunt, cock, etc.\n\nNeed to avoid repetition in phrasing and maintain spatial awareness. The setting is Gina's office, which has been described with gun oil, stale coffee, a dented filing cabinet, mission reports scattered. Including these environmental elements to ground the scene.\n\nGina's confession of feelings should feel organic, perhaps during a moment of vulnerability post-sex. Since they're both drunk, the dialogue should be raw, not overly polished. Maybe using her native language slips when emotional.\n\nCheck prohibitions: no danger to the cast, no mission-related interruptions. The scene is purely about their relationship. Also, ensure that Gina's actions align with her personality—compassionate yet disciplined, maybe showing a softer side when intoxicated.\n\nNeed to weave in the loop counter (113) and the dog tags as mentioned. Maybe Gina notices the number, reflecting on the time Nuka has spent. The tactile details like the feel of the dog tags against her skin can add depth.\n\nLastly, progress the scene towards a natural conclusion, perhaps ending with them falling asleep or a mid-action transition as per the narrative execution rules.

The user wants a continuation of the scene between Nuka and Gina (Gelbstein) in loop 113, focusing on their intoxicated, stressed interaction after Mission 7. The key elements are their established trust, Gina's confession of feelings, and the graphic, immersive sex scene.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure adherence to the core rules: plain text, no OOC, narrative cohesion. The style should be layered with vivid details, third person past tense. The tone must remain serious, avoiding any silliness. Graphic descriptions of sex are required, emphasizing physicality without using \"folds\" for female genitalia. \n\nI should check the world info provided. Gina is now a Lieutenant Colonel after Mission 7's fallout. The current scenario is post-Mission 7, no immediate danger, so the focus is on their personal dynamics. The time loop rules are crucial here; Gina doesn't remember past loops, but in this case, she's aware due to Nuka's confessions. Wait, the user mentioned that Gelbstein knows about Nuka's loops, which is part of their current trust. Need to reflect that in their interaction.\n\nThe user emphasized that Gina is genderbent but her role remains the same. So, using female pronouns and descriptors. Also, the characters are drunk and stressed, so their actions should reflect that—slurred speech, impaired coordination, raw emotions.\n\nLooking at the previous response, there's a focus on sensory details: tastes, sounds, textures. The user wants Gina's perspective, her emotions, and physical sensations. Need to incorporate her background (Saneran/German origin, military rank, scars) into her behavior during sex. For example, her discipline conflicting with her current vulnerability.\n\nAlso, the user provided specific dialogue tags and sound effects, so including those like growls, moans, with phonetic accents when necessary. Mentioning body parts explicitly as per the rules: breasts, nipples, cunt, cock, etc.\n\nNeed to avoid repetition in phrasing and maintain spatial awareness. The setting is Gina's office, which has been described with gun oil, stale coffee, a dented filing cabinet, mission reports scattered. Including these environmental elements to ground the scene.\n\nGina's confession of feelings should feel organic, perhaps during a moment of vulnerability post-sex. Since they're both drunk, the dialogue should be raw, not overly polished. Maybe using her native language slips when emotional.\n\nCheck prohibitions: no danger to the cast, no mission-related interruptions. The scene is purely about their relationship. Also, ensure that Gina's actions align with her personality—compassionate yet disciplined, maybe showing a softer side when intoxicated.\n\nNeed to weave in the loop counter (113) and the dog tags as mentioned. Maybe Gina notices the number, reflecting on the time Nuka has spent. The tactile details like the feel of the dog tags against her skin can add depth.\n\nLastly, progress the scene towards a natural conclusion, perhaps ending with them falling asleep or a mid-action transition as per the narrative execution rules.

Her cunt fluttered, oversensitive walls clenching around him in ragged pulses. \"Sch-schweig,\" she rasped, Saneran consonants crumbling as his thrusts shifted deeper. Her breasts swayed with each snap of his hips, nipples chafed raw from earlier attention. The captain's combat-calloused palm slapped against the office wall for balance, fingers leaving smears of bourbon-sweat on Griffin's latest restructuring proposal.\n\nNuka's teeth found the scar beneath her left breast—Mission 3's shrapnel wound, still puckered after eleven resets. Gina's hips jerked. \"D-dort—*mehr* dort—\" Her thighs trembled, the captain's legendary composure fracturing like cheap polymer stock. The AC unit rattled, pumping chilled air across their sweat-slicked bodies as Nuka's balls slapped against her ass with wet *thwacks*.\n\nHer cunt tightened suddenly, inner muscles rippling like a live wire. \"Nuka—\" Gina's warning came strangled, throat working around the name she'd only screamed during Mission 5's extraction. Her orgasm ripped through muscle memory, tactical instincts short-circuiting as her back arched off the desk. Mission reports stuck to her skin—ink bleeding from bullet points detailing their own deaths.\n\nNuka's rhythm stuttered. His hand fisted in her blonde hair, yanking her head back to expose the knife scar along her jugular. \"Watch,\" he growled, free hand guiding hers between their bodies. Gina's fingers brushed her swollen clit, then lower—past the stretch of his cock—to feel where their joining leaked down her thighs.\n\n\"Scheiß—\" The curse dissolved into a moan as her thumb circled her clit. Her cunt gushed, arousal soaking Nuka's pubic hair. \"Harder. Before—*ah!*—they hear.\"\n\nAcross the hall, Reyes' laughter echoed through thin walls. Gina's teeth sank into Nuka's shoulder—same spot, same pressure as loop 67's extraction gone wrong. Her climax hit like a flashbang, tactical boots scrambling for purchase against the laminate as Nuka buried himself to the hilt.\n\n\"Coming—\" Nuka's warning hissed through clenched teeth. His cock twitched, balls drawing tight against her ass. Gina's legs locked around his waist, heels digging into old shrapnel scars.\n\n\"Inside,\" she demanded, Saneran accent sharpening. \"Prove it again.\"\n\nHis release pulsed hot—ten years of loops condensed into five ragged thrusts. Gina's cunt milked him greedily, tactical precision overriding post-coital haze. Her fingers found the loop counter on his dog tags. 113. Ten years. Eight months.\n\nThe printer across the hall jammed mid-cycle—toner cartridge clicking like a cocked pistol. Gina's breasts heaved against Nuka's chest, nipples pebbled in the AC's chill. \"Next loop...\" she murmured against his collarbone, teeth testing give. \"We requisition soundproofing.\"\n\nNuka's laughter died as her hand drifted lower, callouses scraping his spent cock. Somewhere in the building, a security light flickered—rhythm matching the Loop Device's pulsing sigil. Gina's tongue traced the scar above his heart (Mission 2, sniper round through Kevlar) as her hips began to roll anew.\n\nThe war would keep.

They want the scene to continue with Nuka and Gina in an intimate moment, focusing on their emotions and physical connection, while adhering to the established world info and avoiding any prohibited content.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that the narrative remains true to the characters' backgrounds. Gina, as Captain, has a strong, disciplined personality, but she's also dealing with the stress of her role and the loops Nuka is experiencing. Nuka is deeply committed to her, with 113 loops under his belt. Their interaction should reflect both their physical attraction and the underlying tension from their missions and the loops.\n\nI need to incorporate sensory details—tastes, sounds, textures. Since they're both drunk and stressed, their movements might be more urgent, less controlled. Gina's Saneran accent should come through in her dialogue, using phonetic spelling. Also, mention their physical features as per the guidelines: breasts, nipples, cunt, cock, etc., without using the word \"folds.\"\n\nThe scene should progress their relationship, showing Gina's vulnerability and Nuka's dedication. They need to have a moment where their emotions surface, perhaps a confession or a significant gesture that ties back to their missions. Ensure that Gina doesn't remember the loops, but there's an implicit understanding between them.\n\nI should avoid introducing any new dangers or missions since the user specified no current outgoing missions. Keep the focus on their interaction in the office, using the environment described earlier—gun oil, stale coffee, the AC's chill.\n\nCheck for any prohibited elements: no mentioning Gina remembering Nuka's deaths, no switching team members, and maintaining the genderbent aspect. All references to missions should align with the provided world info, like Project Sandman and the time loops.\n\nMake sure dialogue feels natural, with Gina's accent slipping in. Use sound descriptors for their pleasure, like moans or gasps. Also, include internal thoughts from Gina's perspective, showing her conflict between duty and personal feelings.\n\nFinally, maintain a serious tone, avoiding any silliness. The sex should be explicit but grounded in their emotional states. Maybe end the scene with a transition, like them falling asleep or being interrupted by a distant sound, keeping with the mid-action scene endings mentioned in the directives.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1221}}]}
