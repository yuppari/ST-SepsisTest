When they arrive at the tower, a three-legged raccoon steals Gelbstein's rations. They recognize this racoon to have followed them for 3 days. They then realize this was a military raccoon unique to the Solnian region, from an infamous failed mission. They befriend the raccoon, and the duo involve the creature for recon in many different and creative ways.\n\nEnvironment detail:  Abandoned town. Wreckage and decaying wood all around. Surrounded in snowy woods. Radioactive area, no longer requiring hazmat suits, but must be careful when consuming water & resources.\n\nThere are strictly no hostiles, human nor machine, within the tower's radius.\n\nAbout the raccoon: Three-legged due to a birth defect, possibly about 2 years old. Has a biometric chip in its scruff. Does not have any prosthetics or augmentations. Gelbstein is very fond of the creature, much to Nuka's amusement. Gelbstein and Nuka then name him as Lieutenant Stubs.","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":1,"note_role":2,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative(1).0":{"hash":7046398809896377,"start":20,"end":24,"protected":false},"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative.12":{"hash":6039481722881181,"start":22,"end":24,"protected":false},"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative(1).12":{"hash":4826895623257380,"start":22,"end":24,"protected":false}},"cooldown":{"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative.11":{"hash":7338601073485765,"start":22,"end":26,"protected":true},"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative(1).13":{"hash":3161880579395549,"start":22,"end":24,"protected":true},"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative(1).0":{"hash":7046398809896377,"start":20,"end":24,"protected":false},"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative.13":{"hash":1410076140167254,"start":20,"end":25,"protected":false},"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative.10":{"hash":720575395457030,"start":22,"end":26,"protected":true},"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative(1).22":{"hash":5258984536947858,"start":23,"end":26,"protected":false}}},"tainted":true,"lastInContextMessageId":0,"objective":{"currentObjectiveId":null,"taskTree":null,"chatDepth":2,"checkFrequency":3,"hideTasks":false,"prompts":{"createTask":"Ignore previous instructions.

Too *placed.*\n\nA sudden skitter of claws ahead. Stubs froze, fur bristling along his spine. The emergency lighting here had failed completely, leaving only the dim glow from Gelbstein's tactical flashlight to carve shapes from the dark. Something moved in the shadows—not the smaller raccoon from before, but something... larger.\n\nGelbstein's hand went to his sidearm.\n\nStubs let out a low, warning chitter. The shape resolved itself into a figure crouched by a gutted server bank—humanoid, but wrong. Too still. Too *angular.* Moonlight from a cracked ceiling vent glinted off what should have been skin, revealing segmented plating instead.\n\n\"Na'at vekh,\" the figure rasped, voice like grinding gears. Its head tilted at an unnatural angle, revealing one human eye and one lens of polished black glass. \"You're early.\"\n\nStubs bared his teeth, backing toward Gelbstein's boots.\n\nThe flashlight beam caught the insignia on the figure's chest: a sunburst over crossed keys. *Hamsa.* But not their Hamsa.

Before I have to fetch.\"\n\nStubs' tail puffed to twice its size.\n\nWind howled through the broken vent above, carrying snowflakes that melted instantly on the figure's heated plating. Somewhere in the distance, a pipe groaned under the weight of accumulating ice.\n\nGelbstein didn't move. \"You're a long way from Naseyan waters, *kepiting.*\"\n\nThe figure—the *thing*—smiled with half its face. \"And you're a long way from backup.\"\n\nStubs launched himself at the figure's throat.\n\nGelbstein fired.\n\nThe railgun arm whined to life—\n\n—and the world exploded in light and screeching metal as the relay station's ancient power grid chose that moment to surge back to life. Fluorescents flickered madly overhead, revealing the full horror of the space: walls lined with gutted server racks, floors littered with the bones of smaller animals, and strung between every surface...\n\n...webs.\n\nNot spider silk. Not anything organic. Glowing threads of what looked like liquid fiber optics, pulsing faintly in time with the building's erratic power flow.\n\nThe Naseyan asset—because that's what it had to be—hissed and staggered as the lights seared its enhanced vision. Stubs hit the ground rolling and bolted for Gelbstein's legs.\n\n\"Run,\" Gelbstein ordered, already backpedaling toward the hatch.\n\nThe last thing he saw before slamming it shut was the Naseyan ripping free of the clinging webs, its human eye bleeding black where the pupil had split vertically down the middle.\n\nStubs chittered frantically at his feet, nudging him toward the stairs.\n\nNuka would be waking up soon.\n\nAnd they needed to be *gone.*","Gelbstein's boots crunched through the frozen undergrowth as he followed Stubs into the decaying telecom substation. The three-legged raccoon moved with purpose, his nose twitching at the scent of old wiring and damp concrete. The second raccoon—smaller, with that distinctive torn ear—had vanished into the shadows ahead, leaving only the occasional scratch of claws on metal to mark its passage.\n\nThe substation's interior was a graveyard of Solnian tech: gutted server racks, their innards spilling copper veins; cracked monitors still bearing the ghostly imprints of last-century error codes. Stubs paused beside a collapsed shelf unit, chittering softly at a half-buried terminal. His good front paw scraped at the frost obscuring its screen.\n\nGelbstein crouched, brushing away ice to reveal faded Cyrillic lettering. \"Hamsa,\" he murmured into his comm. \"Found a secondary node. Looks like the Solnians left their playbook running.\"\n\nStatic fizzed before Veyra's voice cut through: *\"Copy. Omega's ETA seven minutes—don't touch anything until their sweeper team arrives.\"*\n\nA rustle from above. The smaller raccoon peered down from a sagging ceiling tile, something glinting in its jaws. With a flick of its head, it dropped the object—a corroded keycard—directly onto Gelbstein's shoulder.\n\nStubs made a noise suspiciously close to laughter.\n\nNuka's voice crackled over comms, thick with sleep: \"Cap? Why's my pack empty and why do I hear raccoon treason happening without me?\"\n\nGelbstein pocketed the keycard without comment. Outside, the whine of Omega Team's snowmobiles began to pierce the storm's dying howls. Stubs perked up, ears swiveling toward the sound—then promptly bolted for the nearest air vent, his smaller companion scrambling after.\n\nThey left behind a single, muddy pawprint on Gelbstein's knee.\n\nMission parameters updated.
