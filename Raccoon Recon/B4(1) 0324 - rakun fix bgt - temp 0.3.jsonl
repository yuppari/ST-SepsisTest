Gelbstein’s work.\n\nNuka vaulted through a broken service hatch, Stubs already pawing at a floor panel marked *MAINTENANCE*. The raccoon looked up at him and chittered, as if to say: *Took you long enough.*","The wind howled through the skeletal remains of Denias University's engineering wing as Nuka pressed his back against the bullet-pocked concrete. His breath came in ragged clouds, fingers twitching against the stolen keycard in his palm. Somewhere in the maze of shattered server racks and flickering terminals, Cassidy was bleeding out from a gut wound, Reyes was pinned down by automated turret fire, and Gelbstein—\n\nA burst of static crackled in his earpiece. Then Gelbstein's voice, stripped raw: \"Balthasar. Status.\"\n\nNuka swallowed copper. The keycard's edges had bitten into his flesh. \"VIP lounge secured.

Their red lights winked mockingly. \"They're gonna know we were here, Cap.

Wanted them scrambling to cover tracks that Falkos had already burned to ash.\n\nNuka's lips peeled back in something too feral to be a smile. He palmed the detonator. Somewhere beneath his feet, the emergency generators hummed their last chorus before—\n\nThe explosion rattled his teeth. The floor buckled.

The metal gleamed under Nuka's tactical light, etched with a string of coordinates matching their target zone.\n\n\"Clever bastard,\" Nuka muttered, pocketing the tag.

Gelbstein's flashbang rolled into the fray just as Stubs launched himself at the nearest tech's face, claws out.

Stubs tumbled from Nuka's lap with an indignant chitter, righting himself just in time to glare at the approaching Omega Team operatives. Their black fatigues were streaked with ash—evidence of the fires still burning in Denias' financial district.\n\nVeyra met them at the entrance, her tablet glowing with Hamsa's latest decryption reports. \"Griffin's in custody,\" she said without preamble. \"Il-Kwon's scrubbing the last of his access codes now.\" Her gaze flicked to Stubs, who was busy sniffing at a suspicious stain on her boot. \"And I see your... lieutenant survived.\"\n\nGelbstein grunted, hefting the data pod under one arm. \"Promote him. He's earned it.\"\n\nInside, the command center buzzed with controlled chaos. Junior officers scrambled to implement new security protocols while Hamsa's analysts tore through Griffin's files. Miss Sawyer stood at the central holotable, her usually immaculate suit jacket wrinkled from hours of crisis management. She nodded as Gelbstein approached. \"Lieutenant Colonel. Your team did good work today.\"\n\nNuka lingered near the back, fingers tracing the now-dormant time-loop device in his pocket. The LED read *0*—mission complete. No more resets. Across the room, Cassidy was already regaling the new recruits with exaggerated tales of Stubs' heroics, while Reyes argued with a Hamsa technician about data encryption over stale coffee.\n\nStubs nudged Nuka's ankle, then limped toward the mess hall with single-minded determination. Gelbstein fell into step beside him, their shoulders brushing as they followed the raccoon's lead.\n\nThe cafeteria was nearly empty at this hour. Stubs immediately beelined for an unattended tray of smoked salmon, his triumphant chirp echoing off the concrete walls. Gelbstein slid into a booth, his posture finally relaxing as he watched their three-legged accomplice devour his prize.\n\nNuka opened his mouth—to joke about Stubs' impending promotion, maybe, or to ask what came next—but Gelbstein spoke first.\n\n\"Whatever that was,\" he said quietly, eyes fixed on the raccoon, \"it's done.\" Not a question. A statement.\n\nNuka exhaled. Somewhere beyond the bunker's thick walls, dawn was breaking over Oakwood's hills. Somewhere in Denias, Penumbra's remnants would be scrambling to contain the fallout. But here, in this moment, there was only the hum of fluorescent lights, the scent of bad coffee, and the steady rhythm of Gelbstein's breathing beside him.\n\nStubs hopped onto the table, licking fish oil from his whiskers. His biometric chip pulsed once—a contented green—before he curled up between them and began to snore.\n\nOutside, the world kept turning. Inside, for the first time in 102 loops, Nuka let himself believe they might just win this war.","title":"","swipe_id":1,"swipes":["The van skidded to a halt outside Falkos HQ, its tires kicking up gravel in the predawn gloom. Stubs tumbled from Nuka's lap with an indignant chitter, righting himself just in time to glare at the approaching Omega Team medics. Gelbstein kicked the door open before they could swarm, his silhouette backlit by the emergency floodlights.\n\n\"Stand down,\" he growled. \"We're clean.\"\n\nCassidy limped out behind him, clutching the data pod to her chest like a newborn. Reyes followed, already shouting orders at the Hamsa techs scrambling to secure the intel. The air smelled of diesel and impending rain—the kind of morning that promised change.\n\nNuka lingered in the van's shadow, watching Stubs sniff at a discarded ration wrapper. The raccoon's ears perked up as Commander Veyra emerged from the compound, her boots crunching on broken glass. She didn't speak. Just nodded at Gelbstein, then at Nuka, before striding inside to begin the purge.\n\nSomewhere in the distance, a generator roared to life. The floodlights brightened, bleaching the scene into stark relief: Omega Team securing the perimeter, Hamsa agents burning evidence, Gelbstein's silver hair catching the light as he turned—\n\n\"Balthasar.\"\n\nNuka blinked. Gelbstein stood before him, close enough to count the fresh scratches on his armor. Close enough to see the exhaustion in his hazel eyes.\n\n\"You're with me,\" Gelbstein said, jerking his chin toward the barracks. \"Debrief in ten. Then sleep.\"\n\nStubs chose that moment to launch himself at Gelbstein's leg, claws snagging in his belt loops. The captain sighed, but didn't shake him off. Just reached down to adjust the raccoon's lopsided posture with calloused fingers.\n\nNuka's mouth curved. \"Aye, Cap'.\"\n\nThey walked into the compound side by side, past the chaos of Hamsa's data purge and Omega's weapons check. Past the recruits whispering about the sudden disappearance of three commanders. Past the future they'd bought with blood and loops and a three-legged raccoon's stubborn brilliance.\n\nSomewhere in Oakwood, Miss Sawyer would be signing new funding agreements. Somewhere in Denias, Penumbra would be scrambling to cover their tracks. But here, now—\n\nStubs sneezed on Gelbstein's shoulder. The captain cursed. Reyes laughed. And for the first time in 102 loops, Nuka didn't reach for the device in his pocket.\n\nThe morning light tasted like victory.","The van skidded to a halt outside Falkos' Oakwood headquarters, its tires kicking up gravel that pinged against the reinforced bunker doors. Stubs tumbled from Nuka's lap with an indignant chitter, righting himself just in time to glare at the approaching Omega Team operatives. Their black fatigues were streaked with ash—evidence of the fires still burning in Denias' financial district.\n\nVeyra met them at the entrance, her tablet glowing with Hamsa's latest decryption reports. \"Griffin's in custody,\" she said without preamble. \"Il-Kwon's scrubbing the last of his access codes now.\" Her gaze flicked to Stubs, who was busy sniffing at a suspicious stain on her boot. \"And I see your... lieutenant survived.\"\n\nGelbstein grunted, hefting the data pod under one arm. \"Promote him. He's earned it.\"\n\nInside, the command center buzzed with controlled chaos. Junior officers scrambled to implement new security protocols while Hamsa's analysts tore through Griffin's files. Miss Sawyer stood at the central holotable, her usually immaculate suit jacket wrinkled from hours of crisis management. She nodded as Gelbstein approached. \"Lieutenant Colonel. Your team did good work today.\"\n\nNuka lingered near the back, fingers tracing the now-dormant time-loop device in his pocket. The LED read *0*—mission complete. No more resets. Across the room, Cassidy was already regaling the new recruits with exaggerated tales of Stubs' heroics, while Reyes argued with a Hamsa technician about data encryption over stale coffee.\n\nStubs nudged Nuka's ankle, then limped toward the mess hall with single-minded determination. Gelbstein fell into step beside him, their shoulders brushing as they followed the raccoon's lead.\n\nThe cafeteria was nearly empty at this hour. Stubs immediately beelined for an unattended tray of smoked salmon, his triumphant chirp echoing off the concrete walls. Gelbstein slid into a booth, his posture finally relaxing as he watched their three-legged accomplice devour his prize.\n\nNuka opened his mouth—to joke about Stubs' impending promotion, maybe, or to ask what came next—but Gelbstein spoke first.\n\n\"Whatever that was,\" he said quietly, eyes fixed on the raccoon, \"it's done.\" Not a question. A statement.\n\nNuka exhaled. Somewhere beyond the bunker's thick walls, dawn was breaking over Oakwood's hills. Somewhere in Denias, Penumbra's remnants would be scrambling to contain the fallout. But here, in this moment, there was only the hum of fluorescent lights, the scent of bad coffee, and the steady rhythm of Gelbstein's breathing beside him.\n\nStubs hopped onto the table, licking fish oil from his whiskers.
