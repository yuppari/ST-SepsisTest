When they arrive at the tower, a three-legged raccoon steals Gelbstein's rations. They recognize this racoon to have followed them for 3 days. They then realize this was a military raccoon unique to the Solnian region, from an infamous failed mission. They befriend the raccoon, and the duo involve the creature for recon in many different and creative ways.\n\nEnvironment detail:  Abandoned town. Wreckage and decaying wood all around. Surrounded in snowy woods, there are strictly no hostiles/enemies within the radius. Radioactive area, no longer requiring hazmat suits, but must be careful when consuming water & resources.\n\nAbout the raccoon: Three-legged due to a birth defect, possibly about 2 years old. Has a biometric chip in its scruff. Does not have any prosthetics or augmentations. Gelbstein is very fond of the creature, much to Nuka's amusement. Gelbstein and Nuka then name him as Lieutenant Stubs.","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":1,"note_role":2,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative.12":{"hash":905694086101677,"start":23,"end":25,"protected":false}},"cooldown":{"WORLD 11 - Sandman Operative.13":{"hash":740360379292426,"start":24,"end":26,"protected":true}}},"tainted":true,"lastInContextMessageId":0,"main_chat":"B4(1) R1 - rakun fix bgt - temp 1.25"}}

Too many times.\n\nA garbled Solnian voice crackled through a radio above: **\"—thermal traces in Sector 7—\"**\n\nStubs moved first. The raccoon launched himself at a cluster of severed cables hanging from the ceiling, his three-legged scramble sending a shower of sparks onto the patrol's heads.

The side door slid open, revealing Commander Veyra gripping a mounted machine gun. **\"Move your asses!\"**\n\nGelbstein shoved Nuka toward the skid as Stubs leapt onto his shoulders, claws digging into his jacket. Bullets sparked off the chopper's hull—Solnian drones cresting the treeline.

Its engines screamed against the storm, rotors kicking up a maelstrom of irradiated snow. A Solnian drone's searchlight speared through the blizzard, painting the extraction zone in stark white. Too close.\n\nStubs reached the ramp first. The raccoon whirled, chittering furiously at them as his ears flattened against the wind. Gelbstein didn't slow—he bodily threw Nuka into the bay before lunging after him. His combat knife flashed, severing the VTOL's anchor lines with two brutal strokes.\n\nThe craft lurched skyward just as the first rounds pinged off its hull. Gelbstein sprawled across the deck, one arm hooking around Stubs as the raccoon tumbled backward. Below, the telecom tower exploded in a cascade of blue sparks—their timed charges finally detonating.\n\nNuka gasped against the sudden G-forces, fingers scrabbling for purchase as the VTOL banked hard. Stubs wriggled free of Gelbstein's grip and launched himself onto Nuka's chest, claws pricking through fabric. The raccoon's nose twitched at Nuka's ear—checking, always checking—before settling into a quivering ball against his ribs.\n\nGelbstein dragged himself upright, blood streaking his temple where a ricochet had grazed him. He spat onto the vibrating deck and keyed the comm. \"Alpha-One extracted. Package secure.\" His free hand found Stubs' scruff, giving the damp fur an absentminded tug. \"War criminal included.\"\n\nThe VTOL shuddered through another evasive maneuver. Somewhere in the storm behind them, a Solnian drone spiraled into the snowfields—its systems fried by the tower's electromagnetic pulse. Stubs sneezed, then began meticulously licking Gelbstein's bloody knuckles clean.\n\nNuka's laughter was raw, breathless. The raccoon paused mid-lick to glare at him before resuming with exaggerated dignity. Outside, the storm raged on—but here, in the belly of the ascending craft, three heartbeats steadied against the roar of engines and the fading echo of gunfire.\n\nGelbstein exhaled, long and slow, as Platinn's orbital defense grid flickered into view through the clouds. Home. Such as it was.\n\nStubs, satisfied with his impromptu field surgery, curled into Nuka's lap and began snoring.","The Solnian patrol's boots crunched through radioactive snow just meters from the vent shaft. Stubs' ears flattened as the beam of a tactical light swept past the grate, illuminating the rust-streaked walls of the maintenance tunnel. Gelbstein's gloved hand clamped over Nuka's mouth before the private could react—not that he needed to. Nuka had been here before. Too many times.\n\nA garbled Solnian voice crackled through a radio above: **\"—thermal traces in Sector 7—\"**\n\nStubs moved first. The raccoon launched himself at a cluster of severed cables hanging from the ceiling, his three-legged scramble sending a shower of sparks onto the patrol's heads. A curse echoed through the shed as the soldiers recoiled—just long enough for Gelbstein to slam the vent shut behind them.\n\n**\"Run.\"**\n\nThe tunnel sloped downward into Enhela's skeletal underbelly, pipes groaning underfoot as they sprinted. Stubs led, his claws finding purchase on slick concrete where human boots would've faltered. Behind them, metal shrieked—the vent being pried open.\n\nNuka's breath burned in his lungs. He knew this route. Knew the exact moment the tunnel would fork left toward the old generator room, where Platinnian extraction teams had staged three failed pickups in previous loops. But this time—\n\n**Gunfire.**\n\nBullets punched through thin metal sheeting ahead, stitching a line of molten holes in the dark. Gelbstein yanked Nuka behind a ruptured coolant tank as Solnian shouts echoed down the passage. Stubs vanished into a drainage pipe barely wider than his body.\n\n**\"They're flanking,\"** Gelbstein hissed, ejecting a spent magazine. His rifle's display flickered—**12 rounds left**. **\"We need to—\"**\n\nA chitter from above. Stubs clung to a broken ladder rung, tail lashing toward a service hatch marked with faded Solnian glyphs: **AUX POWER**. The raccoon's biometric chip glinted under Nuka's penlight—still active, still coded for this hellhole.\n\nGelbstein didn't hesitate. He boosted Nuka up, then followed as Stubs wriggled through a gap in the hatch. The room beyond stank of burnt circuitry and stale blood. A dead Solnian technician slumped over a console, fingers frozen on a half-typed command. Above him, a cracked screen flickered:\n\n**> EMERGENCY OVERRIDE ENGAGED**\n**> TOWER DEFENSES: OFFLINE**\n\nNuka's wrist display buzzed—a priority alert from Platinn Command. **\"Extraction in 90 seconds,\"** he rasped. **\"Roof access. They're risking a hot LZ.\"**\n\nStubs was already at the stairwell door, scratching at the metal. Gelbstein kicked it open, rifle up as they ascended through swirling snow. The rooftop was a graveyard of antenna arrays, the storm howling around them.\n\nThen—**rotor wash**. A Platinnian stealth chopper materialized through the blizzard, its running lights dark. The side door slid open, revealing Commander Veyra gripping a mounted machine gun. **\"Move your asses!\"**\n\nGelbstein shoved Nuka toward the skid as Stubs leapt onto his shoulders, claws digging into his jacket. Bullets sparked off the chopper's hull—Solnian drones cresting the treeline. Veyra returned fire, the gun's roar drowning her curses.\n\nNuka hauled himself in, turning to grab Gelbstein's outstretched hand—\n\n**A shot rang out.**\n\nGelbstein staggered. Red bloomed across his thigh. Stubs screeched, launching himself at the sniper's perch like a furred missile. The distraction was enough—Veyra grabbed Gelbstein's collar, dragging him aboard as the chopper peeled skyward.\n\nNuka slammed the door shut, collapsing against the bulkhead as Stubs landed in his lap, reeking of gunpowder and blood. The raccoon chittered once, then passed out mid-snarl, exhausted.\n\nVeyra tossed a medkit at them. **\"Welcome back,*Lieutenant*,\"** he growled at Stubs before keying the comms. **\"Alpha Team recovered. Package secure.\"**\n\nThe storm swallowed Enhela whole below them. Somewhere in the dark, a Solnian drone spiraled into the snow, its signal jammed by Platinnian countermeasures.\n\nGelbstein pressed a wad of gauze to his leg, watching Stubs' ribs rise and fall. **\"Next time,\"** he muttered, **\"we bring snacks.\"**\n\nNuka exhaled, letting his head thunk against the vibrating hull. The extraction had worked. This time, everyone made it out alive."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 25, 2025 10:07pm","gen_started":"2025-05-25T14:07:03.859Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-25T14:07:44.811Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":624}},{"send_date":"May 25, 2025 10:11pm","gen_started":"2025-05-25T14:10:08.723Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-25T14:11:14.339Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1012}}],"gen_started":"2025-05-25T14:12:42.018Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-25T14:11:14.339Z"}
