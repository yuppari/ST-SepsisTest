His fingers, usually so precise with a rifle's trigger, fumbled with the buckle of his belt, the leather slipping in his sweat-slick grip.\n\nThe cot's metal frame shrieked as Gelbstein shoved Nuka down, pinning him with his full weight. His blue eyes—dark now, pupils blown—locked onto Nuka's with a rawness that made his stomach clench. \"You want it?\" he growled, voice rough with need. \"*Fucking take it.*\"\n\nNuka's laugh was breathless, broken by a gasp as Gelbstein's hand slid between them, calloused fingers wrapping around him with none of the captain's usual restraint. \"Y-Yeah—*fuck*—like that,\" he stammered, hips jerking into the touch.\n\nGelbstein's teeth grazed his ear, a sharp bite that drew a ragged moan. \"*So verdammt ungeduldig,*\" he muttered, but his own movements were just as frantic, just as desperate. His free hand yanked Nuka's boxers down, the fabric catching at his thighs before being shoved aside entirely.\n\nThe first press of skin against skin was electric, almost too much—heat and friction and the slick drag of sweat between them. Nuka's head thudded back against the cot, a broken whine tearing from his throat as Gelbstein rocked against him, their cocks sliding together in a rough, uncoordinated rhythm.\n\n\"*Mehr—*\" Gelbstein gasped, his voice fraying at the edges. His grip tightened, thumb swiping over the head of Nuka's cock in a way that made his vision white out for a second. \"*Scheiße, Nuka—*\"\n\nNuka's fingers tangled in Gelbstein's hair, yanking hard enough to make him hiss. \"Say it *again*,\" he demanded, voice wrecked.\n\nGelbstein's breath stuttered. \"*Ich liebe dich,*\" he rasped, the words raw, almost angry, before crushing their mouths together in a kiss that tasted like whiskey and desperation.\n\nSomewhere on the floor, the time loop device's LED flickered—113—then dimmed to nothing.\n\nIrrelevant.\n\nFor now.","Gelbstein's breath hitched—a rough, punched-out sound—as Nuka ground against him. His fingers dug into Nuka's hips hard enough to bruise, drunken coordination making his movements sloppy but no less desperate. \"Fuck—*Nuka*—\" His voice cracked, the syllables mangled by his accent and arousal.\n\nThe captain's combat pants were still half-on, the fabric straining against his erection. Nuka laughed, breathless, and hooked his fingers into Gelbstein's waistband, yanking hard. \"You talk too much,\" he slurred, dragging him closer. \"Just—*ah*—just fuck me already.\"\n\nGelbstein growled—something low and guttural—and flipped Nuka onto his stomach with none of his usual precision. The cot groaned in protest as he shoved Nuka's thighs apart, fingers digging into the muscle there. \"*So verdammt ungeduldig*,\" he muttered, voice thick.\n\nNuka barely had time to brace himself before Gelbstein was pressing into him, slow and unrelenting. The stretch burned—they hadn't prepped enough, too drunk and impatient—but Nuka arched back into it with a choked gasp. \"*Yes*—fuck—\"\n\nGelbstein's hips snapped forward, burying himself to the hilt in one brutal thrust. Nuka's vision whited out for a second, nails scrabbling at the thin mattress.\n\nA hand fisted in his hair, yanking his head back. Gelbstein's breath was hot against his ear. \"*Ich liebe dich,*\" he repeated, the words rough, almost angry. Like the confession was being torn out of him. \"*Immer.*\"\n\nNuka shuddered, his own cock aching between his legs. \"Prove it,\" he gasped, pushing back against him.\n\nGelbstein obeyed.\n\nThe pace he set was punishing, each thrust driving the air from Nuka's lungs. The cot rattled beneath them, the sound drowned out by their ragged breathing, the slap of skin on skin. Gelbstein's grip on his hip would leave bruises tomorrow—if there *was* a tomorrow. If this loop didn't reset before then.\n\nNuka reached back blindly, fingers tangling in Gelbstein's shirt, dragging him closer. The captain's teeth sank into his shoulder in response—sharp, possessive—and Nuka came with a broken cry, his body tightening around Gelbstein.\n\nThe captain followed moments later, hips stuttering as he spilled inside him with a hoarse groan. He collapsed forward, his weight pressing Nuka into the mattress, both of them panting and slick with sweat.\n\nFor a moment, there was just the sound of their breathing, the distant hum of the base’s generators.\n\nThen Gelbstein shifted, rolling them onto their sides. His arm curled around Nuka's waist, pulling him close. \"*Müde?*\" he murmured, voice rough with exhaustion and alcohol.\n\nNuka huffed a laugh, his limbs heavy. \"Yeah,\" he admitted. His fingers brushed against Gelbstein's wrist—against the pulse point there, steady and alive.\n\nOn the floor, the time loop device's LED flickered—113—before dimming again.\n\nStill green.\n\nStill stable.\n\nFor now."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 21, 2025 7:22pm","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":536}},{"send_date":"May 21, 2025 7:24pm","gen_started":"2025-05-21T11:24:13.871Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-21T11:24:55.329Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":691}}],"gen_started":"2025-05-21T11:24:13.871Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-21T11:24:55.329Z"}
