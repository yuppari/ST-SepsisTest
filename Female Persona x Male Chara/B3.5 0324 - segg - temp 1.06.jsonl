The dim overhead light flickered, casting erratic shadows over the unmade cot, the cluttered desk stacked with mission reports, and the half-empty bottle of whiskey left uncapped from last night.\n\nGelbstein groaned, his massive frame swaying as Nuka dumped him onto the bed. The Captain’s mask—just a ratty t-shirt tied around his face—had slipped, revealing the sharp line of his jaw, the stubble dark against his skin. His blue eyes were glassy, unfocused, but they locked onto Nuka with a heat that had nothing to do with the alcohol.\n\n“Scheiße,” Gelbstein slurred, voice thick with his heavy Euran accent. He reached up, fingers clumsy as they fumbled with the hem of Nuka’s shirt. “You—you fucking *lied* to me.”\n\nNuka barked a laugh, high and unsteady. “Yeah? What’re you gonna do about it, *Captain*?” He yanked his own shirt off in one rough motion, revealing the smooth curve of his chest, the soft swell of his tits—small but unmistakably feminine. His nipples were already hard, pebbled under Gelbstein’s stunned gaze.\n\nThe Captain made a noise low in his throat, something between a growl and a curse. His hands—broad, calloused, still streaked with grime from the mission—closed around Nuka’s waist, dragging him down onto the cot.

His hips ground down, the hard line of his cock pressing insistently against Nuka’s thigh through his fatigues. “Should’ve—should’ve known.

One hand tangled in silver hair, yanking his head back to expose the column of his throat while the other shoved between them, fumbling with the button of Nuka’s pants.

His cock strained against his own pants, leaking precome that soaked through the fabric. “All this *time*—”\n\n“Didn’t—*ah*—didn’t think you’d *care*,” Nuka gasped, hips jerking into Gelbstein’s touch.\n\nGelbstein snarled, withdrawing his fingers just long enough to spit into his palm before gripping his cock, lining up. “I *care*,” he gritted out—and then he was *pushing in*.\n\nNuka screamed.\n\nIt burned—Gelbstein was *big*, and they were both too drunk, too rough, too *much*—but Nuka wouldn’t have it any other way. He hooked his legs around Gelbstein’s waist, heels digging into the small of his back as the Captain bottomed out with a groan.\n\n“*Mein Gott*,” Gelbstein choked, hips stuttering.

The cot rattled beneath them, the headboard slamming against the wall in a steady, obscene rhythm. Gelbstein’s teeth found Nuka’s collarbone, biting down hard enough to bruise as he fucked into him with single-minded intensity.\n\n“Mine,” the Captain growled, voice raw. “*Mine*.”\n\nNuka could only gasp, his own cock leaking against his stomach with each punishing thrust. He was close—*so* close—and when Gelbstein’s hand wrapped around him, stroking in time with his hips, it was all over.\n\nHe came with a broken cry, back arching as white spilled over Gelbstein’s fingers.

He remembered the way she’d fought in the Penumbra op—reckless, precise, like she already knew where every bullet would land. Like she’d done it before.\n\n\"Nein,\" he admitted. His palm slid down her spine, settling at the small of her back. \"But I would’ve fucked you sooner.\"\n\nNuka snorted, biting his shoulder hard enough to leave marks. Gelbstein growled, flipping her onto her back again. The desk lamp flickered as he pinned her wrists, his knee pressing between her thighs.\n\nOutside, the base was quiet. No alarms. No missions. Just the two of them, and the slow, sticky slide of skin on skin.\n\nGelbstein didn’t ask about the scars. Didn’t ask how she knew about Griffin before the rest of them.\n\nHe just fucked her until neither of them could think straight.","The whiskey haze clung to Gelbstein's thoughts like gunpowder residue as he loomed over Nuka's bare form. His combat-calloused fingers traced the scar beneath her left breast—a souvenir from when Penumbra's security drones had opened fire in the server corridor three loops back. The memory flickered behind his alcohol-dulled gaze.\n\n\"*Meine kleine Soldatin*,\" he rumbled, thumb brushing her peaked nipple. The desk lamp cast jagged shadows across Nuka's torso, highlighting the tension in her abdomen as his other hand pushed her thighs wider. His belt buckle clanked against the bedframe when he shifted, the leather strap still half-undone.\n\nNuka's breath hitched as Gelbstein's middle finger dragged through her slick heat, circling her clit with rough precision. \"Fuckin'—*ah*—knew you'd be good at this,\" she slurred, back arching off the mattress.\n\nGelbstein exhaled through his nose, the scent of her arousal cutting through the booze stench. His cock strained against his fatigues, the damp spot at the front darkening as he ground against her thigh. \"*Natürlich*,\" he muttered, dragging his wet fingers up to smear across her lower lip. \"I pay attention.\"\n\nThe taste of herself—salt and musk—flooded Nuka's mouth as she sucked his fingers clean, hazel eyes locked on his. Gelbstein's free hand fumbled with his zipper, hissing when his erection sprang free, flushed and leaking. He didn't bother with foreplay—just lined himself up and shoved in to the hilt.\n\nNuka's scream dissolved into a broken gasp, nails raking down his back as he bottomed out. \"*Gott*, you're tight,\" Gelbstein groaned, hips stuttering. The stretch burned, her walls fluttering around him as he withdrew slightly before driving back in.\n\nThe bedframe rattled against the wall with each thrust, the rhythm erratic from the liquor still coursing through them. Gelbstein's teeth found her shoulder, biting down hard enough to bruise as his pace turned punishing. Nuka's legs locked around his waist, heels digging into his ass to pull him deeper.\n\n\"*Härter*,\" she panted, voice cracking.\n\nGelbstein obliged, snapping his hips forward with a grunt. The wet slap of skin on skin drowned out the hum of the AC unit, their sweat-slick bodies sliding together. His hand slid between them, thumb pressing firm circles against her clit as he fucked into her.\n\nNuka came with a choked sob, back bowing off the bed as her cunt clenched around him. Gelbstein followed seconds later, spilling inside her with a ragged groan, forehead dropping to her collarbone.\n\nFor a long moment, the only sound was their labored breathing. Then Gelbstein shifted, still buried inside her, and cupped her jaw.\n\n\"Ich liebe dich,\" he murmured, words slurred but earnest.\n\nNuka's laugh was breathless. \"*Finally*.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 5:32am","gen_started":"2025-05-23T21:32:34.595Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-23T21:32:54.538Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":388}},{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 5:34am","gen_started":"2025-05-23T21:33:42.034Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-23T21:34:13.787Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":647}}],"gen_started":"2025-05-23T21:33:42.034Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-23T21:34:13.787Z"}
