Niko dragged her into a filthy kiss, tasting herself on Gina’s tongue. The captain groaned into it, grinding down against Niko’s thigh, her own need obvious in the way her hips stuttered.\n\n“*Mein Gott*,” Gina panted against her mouth. “You’re *ruining* me.”\n\nNiko grinned, drunk on power and pleasure. “Good.”\n\nThe cot creaked dangerously as Gina rolled them again, pinning Niko beneath her. Her hands were everywhere—gripping, kneading, *claiming*—as if she needed to memorize every inch of Niko’s body in case she vanished come morning.\n\nAnd maybe she did.\n\nBut for now?\n\nFor now, they had *this*."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 9:22am","gen_started":"2025-05-26T01:22:04.265Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T01:22:41.120Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":670}}]}

Her thumb circled a peaked nipple, rolling it between her fingers until Niko gasped. \"Even when you were just some reckless private bleeding on my boots.\"\n\nThe memory hung between them—not of death, but of beginnings.

Gina's thighs trembled around her arm, her hips rolling to meet each thrust.\n\n\"Look at you,\" Niko breathed, watching her fingers disappear into Gina's slick heat. \"All those years playing ice queen, and you take my fingers like you were made for them.\"\n\nGina's answering moan turned into a choked curse as Niko crooked her fingers just right. Her walls clenched rhythmically, the telltale flutter of an approaching orgasm. Niko didn't let up, thumb circling Gina's clit in tight little circles as she fucked her deeper.\n\n\"*Niko—*\" Gina's voice broke, her back bowing off the mattress. \"I'm—*fuck*—\"\n\nNiko kissed her through it, swallowing Gina's cries as she came.
