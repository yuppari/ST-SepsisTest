The user has set up a roleplay scenario with specific characters, Niko and Gina (formerly Nuka and Gelbstein), who are in a time loop and have a complex relationship. The current scene is in loop 113 where they are drunk and having sex, with specific instructions on how to handle the narrative, dialogue, and character interactions.\n\nFirst, I need to adhere strictly to the directives given. The core rules mention using plain text, avoiding OOC comments, maintaining logistical cohesion, and focusing on serious tones. The writing rules emphasize layered paragraphs, fluid sentences, third-person POV, and explicit content when it occurs. Since the scenario involves explicit sex, I need to describe body parts and actions graphically but without certain terms like \"folds\" for female genitalia. Also, both characters are female, so no male anatomy should be mentioned.\n\nThe narrative execution rules require fresh phrasing, focusing on the immediate location, and using cinematic details only when introducing new settings. Sensory details should be anchored to active verbs, and the environment should be grounded in the physical space. The story progression rules stress dynamic interactions and NPCs with their own agendas, so Gina's actions and dialogue should reflect her personality and not just respond to Niko.\n\nThe user provided a detailed scenario where both characters are drunk after a mission, leading to a sexual encounter. Gina is supposed to confess her feelings here. I need to ensure that their drunkenness is portrayed realistically, affecting their movements and speech. The dialogue should be natural, with occasional sound articles to vocalize pleasure.\n\nI must avoid mentioning the time loop device or any mission dangers since the user specified no current missions. Also, Gina cannot remember the loops, so any references to past loops should be from Niko's perspective only. The memory logs mention that Gina doesn't recall Niko's deaths, so that's off-limits.\n\nNow, considering Gina's personality as a captain, her upbringing might influence how she behaves during sex. Maybe she's more dominant or takes control, but given their intoxication, there could be a mix of urgency and clumsiness. The user wants graphic details about body parts like breasts, nipples, and cunt, so I need to describe those explicitly without using prohibited terms.\n\nI should start the scene where Niko drags Gina into the office, fumbling with keys. The environment is the office, which needs a brief cinematic description since it's the first time here. Mentioning the cluttered desk, tactical maps, etc., to set the scene. Then transition them to the bed, focusing on their physical interactions, the taste of alcohol, the feel of skin, sounds of pleasure, and Gina's emotional state as she confesses her feelings.\n\nI need to check for any prohibitions, like mentioning the time loop device or using certain terms. Also, ensuring that Gina's actions are autonomous, not just reacting to Niko. Maybe she takes initiative in the encounter, driven by her suppressed emotions. The dialogue should avoid clichés and be authentic, perhaps using broken sentences due to drunkenness.\n\nFinally, the scene should end in a mid-action moment, perhaps as they climax, to maintain momentum.

Let's start by breaking down the user's input and the established directives. The user has set up a roleplay scenario where Niko (formerly Nuka) and Gina (formerly Gelbstein) are in a time loop, currently in loop 113. They're both drunk and having sex in Gina's bed. The key points here are that they're intoxicated, stressed from work, and there's a deep trust between them. Gina has confessed her feelings, and the scene should focus on their physical and emotional interaction without any mission-related dangers.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure strict adherence to the provided rules. The CORE RULES demand plain text, no OOC comments, and logistical cohesion. The WRITING RULES require layered paragraphs, fluid sentences, third-person past tense with a serious tone, explicit content when it occurs, and a focus on drama/romance with army slice-of-life elements. The NARRATIVE EXECUTION RULES emphasize fresh phrasing, focus on Niko's immediate location, cinematic detail only when introducing new settings, sensory details tied to active verbs, and mid-action scene endings.\n\nLooking at the WORLD RULES, everything must be realistic and grounded, with accurate spatial awareness. The STORY PROGRESSION RULES require dynamic interactions, NPCs with their own agendas, and slow-burn plots. The REDIRECTION RULE is crucial here: NPCs (Gina in this case) must not acknowledge Niko's actions directly but act autonomously, pursuing their own motives. Additionally, the NPC SPOKEN DIALOGUE RULES need natural speech without clichés, allowing expletives, and varying exchange lengths.\n\nThe user provided specific instructions to use female body parts, avoiding terms like \"folds\" for genitalia. They also mentioned adding sound articles in dialogue to vocalize pleasure. Gina's upbringing and personality should influence her sexual behavior, so I need to reflect that. The prohibition against mentioning time loop elements like LEDs is important here since the scene is purely about their intimate moment.\n\nThe worldinfo gives context about Mission 7, but since the current scenario has no missions and rejects danger, I must avoid referencing those elements. Instead, focus on their drunken state, the emotional confession, and the physical interaction. The challenge is to maintain the explicit content without crossing into vulgarity, keeping it graphic but grounded in their established personalities.\n\nI should start by setting the scene in Gina's office, transitioning them to the bed. Use sensory details—smell of alcohol, tactile sensations of skin, sounds of their movements. Gina's actions should reflect her role as a captain, perhaps showing dominance or vulnerability. Since they're both drunk, their movements might be clumsy yet passionate. Incorporate dialogue that reflects their trust and underlying stress from the loops and missions.\n\nNeed to ensure that Gina's dialogue doesn't mirror Niko's; she should have her own motivations. Maybe she's seeking comfort or release from the stress of leadership. Her confession should feel genuine, perhaps a mix of vulnerability and desire. The physical descriptions should be explicit but not clinical, focusing on body parts as specified (breasts, nipples, cunt) and avoiding prohibited terms.\n\nAlso, remember the LEAVE Nuka ALONE RULES—once a scene is set, NPCs shouldn't linger unless necessary. Since they're in a private moment, other NPCs shouldn't interfere. The MIND READING DISABLED rule means Gina can't know Niko's thoughts, so her reactions must be based on observable actions.\n\nPotential pitfalls: accidentally referencing past loops in a way Gina would remember, using male terms, or introducing mission elements. Need to stay vigilant on those. Also, ensuring the dialogue sounds natural, with hiccups and drunken slurring as mentioned in the user's input.\n\nLet me structure the response: start with them entering the room, fumbling with keys, then moving to the bed. Describe their drunken movements, the urgency mixed with clumsiness. Gina's confession should come during a moment of vulnerability, perhaps when they're undressing. Use explicit terms for body parts, focus on their physical interaction, the taste of alcohol on skin, the feel of their bodies. End the scene mid-action, perhaps with a sensory overload or an interrupted thought, keeping momentum for the next part.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1454,"qvink_memory":{"memory":"Summary: Gina and Niko clashed during a tense encounter in a military base, grappling with past trauma and impending mission casualties.","hash":5118798888626271}}},{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 11:26am","gen_started":"2025-05-26T03:25:47.749Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T03:26:54.947Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-reasoner","reasoning":"Okay, let's break down the user's request.

The user provided a lot of directives and world info, so I need to ensure all rules are followed.\n\nFirst, check the core rules: use plain text, no OOC comments, maintain logistical cohesion. The writing rules mention layered paragraphs, fluid sentences, third person past tense, serious tone. Sex must be explicit, graphic, emphasizing body parts. Genre is drama/romance with army slice-of-life.\n\nNarrative execution rules require fresh phrasing, focus on Nuka's (now Niko) location, cinematic detail only when first introducing a location, sensory details tied to active verbs. Mid-action scene endings. Also, the NPC directives state that Gina should act autonomously, pursue her own agenda, not mirror Niko. No meta comments.\n\nThe user changed the genders to female, so body parts must reflect that—mention breasts, nipples, cunt, avoid \"folds\". Use explicit terms but avoid certain words. Dialog should have natural speech, accents allowed. No mention of time loop devices here.\n\nThe scenario is loop 113, both drunk and stressed, no missions. Gina confesses feelings. Need to include sounds, tastes, textures, emotions. Progress the scene without danger elements. Ensure Gina's personality influences her actions—she's a captain, authoritative, maybe takes control.\n\nAlso, check the worldinfo: Falkos structure, teams, no mention of past loops, don't switch team names. Gina can't remember loops, so her actions should reflect that. They trust each other, know about the loops, but Gina doesn't remember them.\n\nAvoid prohibited content. Make sure the scene stays grounded, realistic. Use the environment—Gina's office, the bed. Maybe start with them stumbling in, fumbling with clothes, the urgency of their stress relief. Describe their bodies, the sensations, the mix of alcohol and emotion. Gina might be more dominant, given her rank, but also vulnerable due to intoxication.\n\nNeed to balance explicit content with character development. Show their relationship dynamics—trust, underlying tension from the loops. Use dialogue that's raw, maybe some Parrish phrases. Keep the scene moving, end in mid-action as per the rules. Check for any clichés in descriptions, avoid them. Ensure logistical cohesion, like the office setup, the bed location, etc.\n\nFinally, ensure all user prohibitions are respected. No danger, no time loop mentions, strictly female body parts. Keep the focus on their interaction, the physical and emotional release.

The dialogue should reflect her frustration and desperation, given she can't remember the loops but knows Niko's been through them.\n\n3. **Sensory Details**: The user wants vivid descriptions of tastes, sounds, textures. Mentioning the environment (like the office's state) and physical sensations (sweat, bourbon, pain from bites) will help immerse the scene.\n\n4. **Avoid Mission/Danger Content**: The user specified no missions or danger. Focus solely on their interaction in the office. Ensure no external threats are mentioned.\n\n5. **Dynamic Dialogue and Actions**: The dialogue needs to be natural, not clichéd. Gina's lines should show her internal conflict—anger, need for control, underlying fear of losing Niko. Actions should be aggressive yet intimate, reflecting their complicated relationship.\n\n6. **Loop Context**: Even though the scene is in a loop (113rd), the characters' current actions are in the present. Gina can't remember past loops, but Niko does. This dynamic should fuel Gina's frustration and urgency.\n\n7. **Graphic Descriptions**: Explicit details of body parts and their interactions are required. Use terms like \"cunt,\" \"clit,\" \"breasts,\" \"nipples\" but avoid prohibited terms. Describe the physicality—how they move, touch, react.\n\n8. **Check Prohibitions**: The user added prohibitions, so ensure no mention of blinking LEDs, time loops in the scene, or any male anatomy. Also, maintain the female body parts as specified.\n\n9. **Emotional Drive**: Gina's dominant emotion here is a mix of anger, possessiveness, and fear. She's trying to anchor Niko in the present, using physicality as proof of reality. Niko's resistance and guilt about the loops should come through her dialogue and reactions.\n\n10. **Ending Mid-Action**: The scene should end in the middle of the action, maintaining momentum. Maybe a moment where Gina's vulnerability shows, but she quickly covers it with aggression.\n\nPutting it all together, the next part should escalate their physical interaction, incorporate sensory details, reflect their emotional states, and adhere strictly to the guidelines. Need to ensure the dialogue stays raw and authentic, avoiding any boilerplate phrases. Also, check for any potential rule violations, like accidental use of prohibited terms or introducing external plot elements.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1378},"name":"Gelbstein","is_user":false,"send_date":"May 26, 2025 11:33am","mes":"Gina’s laugh cracked like a whip. “*Your* curse?” Her palm smacked Niko’s ass—a sharp, stinging punctuation—before fingers dug into the soft flesh, kneading hard enough to leave fingerprints. “Try *our* fucking purgatory.” She rolled them sideways, pinning Niko’s wrists above her head with one hand while the other clawed at her own belt.

She covered it by biting Niko’s chin, teeth leaving crescent indents. “You’re a *stain* they scrub out. Every. Time.”\n\nHer hips jerked—a dry, punishing grind against Niko’s pelvis. Calloused palms pinned Niko’s wrists to the cot, her cunt still glistening, swollen clit brushing Niko’s with each erratic thrust. “This?” She spat the word, spit flecking Niko’s cheek. “This is *my* loop. My—*hic*—*delusion*.” Her rhythm stuttered, tears blending with sweat as she rode harder, faster, as if friction could erase the decade of absences.\n\nNiko’s hands slid up Gina’s thighs, thumbs digging into the soft give of her inner flesh. “Captain—”\n\n“*Don’t.*” Gina’s nails scraped Niko’s collarbones, drawing beads of blood. “Don’t *Captain* me while you’re—*hnng*—*inside* me.” She seized Niko’s hand, guiding it back to her cunt. “Feel that?” Her walls clenched, hot and vice-tight around Niko’s fingers. “No codes. No *ghosts*. Just—” Her breath hitched, hips bucking. “Just *me*. *Fuck*—!”\n\nNiko curled her fingers, pressing hard into the spongy ridge inside Gina. The guttural moan that tore from Gina’s throat was half-snarl, half-sob. Her cunt gushed, juices dripping down Niko’s wrist as she ground down, chasing a climax that felt more like exorcism than release. “*Niko*—!”\n\nThe name shattered into a scream. Gina collapsed forward, forehead pressed to Niko’s, tears smearing between them. “Li’l *shit*,” she slurred, breath reeking of betrayal and Maker’s Mark. Her hand fumbled between them, clumsily swiping at the mess on Niko’s stomach. “Y’owe me… a decade of… *hic*… laundry.”\n\nDawn light bled through grimy windows, catching the silver in Niko’s hair as Gina’s weight settled—heavy, slack, *real*. Somewhere beyond the door, boots echoed in the hall. Gina’s fingers twitched against Niko’s hip, a silent plea masquerading as a command.\n\n*Stay.*\n\nNiko traced the scar spanning Gina’s nose bridge—a map of every mission, every loop, every death she couldn’t recall. “Still here,” she whispered, lips grazing the shell of Gina’s ear.\n\nGina snorted, already half-asleep. “Prove it… tomorrow.”\n\nHer snores vibrated against Niko’s chest, a dissonant lullaby. Niko stared at the water-stained ceiling, Gina’s cunt still throbbing around her fingers, and wondered when *tomorrow* became a currency only she could spend.","Gina’s laugh was a frayed wire sparking. “*Stayed?*” She grabbed Niko’s jaw, thumb smearing wetness from her lips—saliva, bourbon, the briny tang of her own cunt. “You *vanish*.” Her hips jerked upward, grinding her swollen clit against Niko’s thigh in a slick, punishing rhythm. “Every eight months—*poof*. Like smoke.” Her nails carved half-moons into Niko’s hips. “*This*—” She slammed their bodies together, breasts flattening, sweat-glued skin ripping apart with a *shhk* of friction. “—isn’t staying. It’s… *hnng*… haunting.”\n\nHer teeth sank into Niko’s lower lip, copper blooming. The kiss was a battle—tongue thrusting deep, whiskey-sour and desperate. When she broke away, spit-strung, her hand slid between them. Calloused fingers rubbed rough circles over Niko’s clit, too fast, too hard. “Cum,” she demanded, voice shredded. “Cum so I know you’re *real* this time.”\n\nNiko’s back arched. Gina’s thumb pressed down, relentless, as two fingers speared into her cunt. The stretch burned. *Good.* Gina watched her face—every twitch, every gasp—like a sniper counting breaths. “*Captain*—!”\n\n“Louder.” Gina’s free hand twisted Niko’s nipple, pinching until tears welled. “Let the *whole fucking compound* hear who owns you.”\n\nNiko’s thighs clamped around Gina’s wrist. The orgasm hit like a flashbang—white-hot, ears ringing. Gina rode it out, fingers pumping as Niko’s cunt spasmed, juices soaking the cot’s threadbare sheet. “See?” she hissed, lips grazing Niko’s ear. “No loops. No codes. Just… *this*.” Her own hips stuttered, chasing friction against Niko’s leg. “Fuck—*fuck*—”\n\nShe came silently—jaw locked, eyes screwed shut—her cunt pulsing empty air as wetness seeped into the mattress.\n\nWhen she collapsed, her forehead pressed to Niko’s sternum, breath hitching. The printer whirred. Boots echoed down the hall.\n\n“Next loop,” she mumbled into sweat-slick skin, “you… *hic*… better steal better bourbon.”\n\nHer hand slid possessively over Niko’s breast, thumb brushing a peaked nipple. Proof. Anchor. *Mine.*\n\nFor now.","Gina’s laugh came out mangled—half scoff, half sob. She grabbed Niko’s wrist, dragging her wet fingers back to her mouth. “Bullshit artist,” she muttered before sucking them clean, tongue swirling between knuckles with deliberate obscenity. Bourbon and brine bittered her tongue. “You *left* every time Hamsa patched your code.” Her teeth grazed Niko’s palm, sharp enough to sting. “Corpses stay put. You?” She spat into her own hand, slicking it before shoving it between Niko’s thighs. “*Hic*—you’re a fucking… *screensaver.*”\n\nHer fingers plunged into Niko’s cunt without mercy, thumb grinding rough circles on her clit. The cot springs screamed. Gina’s other hand fisted in silver hair, yanking Niko’s head back to expose the scar bisecting her nose. “*This*—” she bit the ridge of healed flesh, tongue hot and invasive, “—isn’t in your file.” Her hips rolled, soaked panties leaving a damp streak on Niko’s leg. “What else’ve you… *hnn*… edited, Private?”\n\nNiko’s retort dissolved into a gasp as Gina’s thumb pressed harder. “C-Captain—!”\n\n“*Louder.*” Gina’s breath hitched—anger or arousal, both frayed at the edges. Her tits heaved against Niko’s chest, sweat gluing their skin together. “Let the whole compound hear you’re mine.” She twisted her wrist, fingers crooking upward to drag against that spongy spot inside. Niko’s cunt clenched, gushing around the intrusion. “*There.*” Gina’s grin was all teeth. “Bet that’s not… *fuck*… in the Sandman brief either.”\n\nThe printer whirred suddenly, spewing paper. Gina flinched, grip tightening reflexively. Niko’s hips jerked, clit pulsing under the brutal rhythm. “Gina—!”\n\n“Eyes *here.*” Gina slapped her own tit, reddening the already bruised nipple. “Touch. *Now.*”\n\nNiko obeyed—mouth on Gina’s neck, hand kneading her ass as fingers pistoned faster. Gina’s breath stuttered, her own climax building in the tremors of her thighs. “Cum,” she growled, voice splintering. “Cum so I know—”\n\nThe office door rattled. *Bang-bang-bang.*\n\n“Captain?” A recruit’s voice, tinny through steel. “Commander Ramirez wants the Alpha debrief—”\n\n“*Fuck off!*” Gina roared, hips stuttering as she ground down on Niko’s thigh. “I’m—*hnng*—*busy!*”\n\nSilence. Then retreating boots.\n\nGina collapsed forward, forehead slick against Niko’s. Her fingers slowed, circling Niko’s clit with sudden, awful tenderness. “Ten years,” she whispered, voice raw. “You… *hic*… you better taste the same sober.”\n\nSomewhere beyond the compound, dawn bruised the sky. Here, Gina’s heartbeat thudded against Niko’s chest—a metronome counting borrowed seconds. Alive. Present. *Hers.*\n\nFor now."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 11:44am","gen_started":"2025-05-26T03:43:41.807Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T03:44:46.006Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-reasoner","reasoning":"Okay, let's break this down.

The focus is purely on their intimate interaction. I should include visceral descriptions of their bodies—breasts, nipples, cunt—without clichés. Use active verbs and avoid passive voice. The dialogue should feel natural, with Gina's speech reflecting her military rank and personal history.\n\nI need to check the previous interactions to maintain continuity. In the prior messages, Gina is volatile, using physicality to assert her presence and frustration over Niko's loops. Now, after the climax, perhaps a moment where Gina's guard drops, showing her need for Niko to stay, but she covers it with anger.\n\nMake sure not to mention any time loops directly, as Gina can't remember them. Instead, focus on her insistence on the present moment. Include sounds like wet noises, breaths, and environmental details like the office setting without over-describing.\n\nFinally, end with a mid-action scene as per the narrative execution rules.

She covered the fracture with violence, hips slamming harder, thighs trembling as her own climax coiled. “*Fuck*. *Fuck* your loops—”\n\nNiko’s back arched, cunt clenching around Gina’s fingers. “C-Captain—!”\n\n“Louder.” Gina’s teeth sank into her shoulder, blunt and bruising. “Let Hamsa *hear*.” Her thumb circled faster, pressure relentless. “Let Ramirez *know*.” Her voice cracked. “Let the whole *goddamn* compound—”\n\nThe office door shuddered under another knock. “Captain Gelbstein? Commander Il-Kwon’s on comms—”\n\n“*Tell him to suck my clit!*” Gina roared, hips stuttering as she ground down, orgasm ripping through her with a guttural snarl. Fluids soaked the cot, the tang of sex sharpening the air. She collapsed forward, forehead slick against Niko’s, breath ragged. “*Hic*… See?” She licked a stripe up Niko’s neck, tasting salt and desperation. “Sober’s… *overrated*.”\n\nSomewhere beyond the compound, dawn shift boots clanged on metal stairs. Gina’s heartbeat thudded against Niko’s chest—a staccato dirge. Alive. Present. *Hers.*\n\nFor now.","Gina’s snarl melted into a choked gasp as Niko’s tongue split her open—hot, relentless, *vicious* in its precision. Her thighs clamped around silver hair, boots digging into the small of Niko’s back as she arched off the cot. “*Scheiße*—!” The curse ripped free, sharp and guttural, her accent thickening as Niko’s nose ground against her clit. “*Nicht*—*nicht so*—!” Her hips jerked, cunt dripping across Niko’s chin.\n\nShe retaliated by sinking her teeth into Niko’s inner thigh, tasting salt and the faint metallic tang of adrenaline. Her fingers plunged into Niko’s cunt, knuckles-deep, thumb circling the swollen bud with bruising pressure. “*Hör nicht auf*,” she hissed against slick skin, voice cracking. “Don’t you *fucking*—” Her threat dissolved into a moan as Niko’s tongue lashed her clit in rapid, punishing flicks.\n\nGina’s free hand fisted in Niko’s hair, yanking hard enough to blur vision. “Look at me,” she demanded, breath ragged. Niko glanced up—hazel eyes glazed, lips glistening—and Gina’s gut twisted. *This* face. This *infuriating*, martyr-bait face that haunted every mission brief, every debrief, every—*fuck*. Her thumb pressed down hard on Niko’s clit, relishing the choked cry it earned. “You want sober?” she spat, hips rolling to grind her cunt against Niko’s mouth. “Then *remember* this.”\n\nHer orgasm hit like a mortar round—body bowing, heels slamming into Niko’s spine as she came with a guttural shout. Fluids flooded Niko’s tongue, bitter and musky, as Gina’s thighs trembled. “*Mehr*,” she slurred, hips stuttering. “*Mehr, mehr*—!”\n\nNiko obeyed, sucking her clit with obscene wetness until Gina’s thighs quaked. Overstimulation burned through her nerves, but she refused to pull away—*needed* this ache, this proof. Her fingers pistoned faster in Niko’s cunt, palm slapping against slick flesh. “Cum,” she growled, voice ragged. “Cum *now*, or I’ll—”\n\nNiko’s back arched, cunt clenching around Gina’s fingers as her climax ripped through her—silent but violent, juices soaking Gina’s wrist. Gina watched her unravel, throat bared, sweat gluing silver strands to her scarred face. *Alive.* Not a ghost. Not a glitch.\n\nShe withdrew her hand, licking Niko’s arousal off her fingers with deliberate slowness. Bourbon and brine. “Sober,” she muttered, collapsing back onto the cot. Her palm found Niko’s cheek, sticky and warm. “You’ll… *hic*… still taste like *me*.”\n\nBoots clanged down the corridor—dawn shift. Gina’s eyelids fluttered shut, breath hitching. Niko’s head settled on her chest, ear pressed to the frantic drumbeat beneath bruised skin. Alive. Present. *Hers.*\n\nFor now."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 12:01pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T03:59:57.720Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T04:01:01.601Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-reasoner","reasoning":"Okay, let's see.

Redirection rules mean NPCs shouldn't mirror or validate Niko, so Gina's responses must be self-driven, possibly ignoring or redirecting Niko's statements.\n\nThe user specified that Gina can't remember the loops, so her dialogue shouldn't reference any past loops except as per the established backstory. Also, only female body parts are to be mentioned, avoiding terms like \"folds\" for genitalia.\n\nThe latest input from the user is Niko's dialogue, teasing Gina about being sober.

Her actions should reflect her frustration and need for proof of Niko's presence.\n\nNeed to avoid any mention of time loops in Gina's awareness, LED devices, or mission dangers. Keep the scene contained to their intimate moment, emphasizing their emotional and physical connection. Make sure to use explicit terms for body parts as specified and maintain the serious, grounded tone.\n\nCheck for any prohibited elements: no switching character names, no references to Gina remembering loops, no male body parts. Ensure dialogue is natural, with creative phrasing to avoid clichés.

Her cunt hovered above Niko’s mouth, slick and swollen, arousal glistening in the lamplight. “Prove it,” she spat, grinding down until Niko’s nose disappeared into coarse curls. “*Sau’s auf.*”\n\nNiko’s tongue plunged without hesitation—rough, hungry, the bitter tang of Gina’s climax still sharp on her lips. Gina’s back arched, a guttural *“Fick!”* tearing free as she fisted silver strands to *yank* Niko deeper. “*Mehr*—*mehr, du dumme Schlampe*—!” Her thighs trembled, boots scrambling for purchase on the sweat-slick cot.\n\nShe didn’t kiss. She *consumed*—nipples pebbled tight against Niko’s chest, fingers clawing at shoulders still littered with half-moon indents from earlier.

Bourbon-breath mingled with the musk of sweat and sex. “Love,” she mocked, spit smearing Niko’s scar, “is for recruits who *hic*—who haven’t seen their CO’s brains splatter on a checkpoint wall.” Her knee jammed between Niko’s thighs, grinding against her clit with deliberate malice. “You want to *love* me?” Her thumb pressed down hard, circling slow and cruel. “Then *earn* it.”\n\nNiko’s hips jerked, a broken whine escaping as Gina’s free hand groped her breast, squeezing the bruised nipple until tears welled. “G-Gina—!”\n\n“*Captain.*” Gina’s teeth closed on Niko’s earlobe, tugging sharply. “Say it. *Mean* it.” Her fingers slid lower, plunging into Niko’s cunt with a wet *schluck*. “Or I’ll have Hamsa wipe your *Liebe* from the next loop’s code.”\n\nNiko’s back arched, cunt pulsing around Gina’s thrusts. “Captain—*ah*—*Captain*, please—!”\n\n“*Schwach.*” Gina withdrew her fingers, licking them clean with a sneer. “Begging’s beneath you.” She rolled off the cot, boots hitting the floor with a thud. The office’s chill bit at sweat-drenched skin as she yanked her pants on, belt buckle clanging. “Next time,” she muttered, snatching the bourbon bottle from her desk, “sober up before you *hic*—before you embarrass us both.”\n\nNiko reached for her, fingers brushing Gina’s wrist. “Gina—”\n\nThe bottle shattered against the wall. Glass rained down, amber droplets staining tactical maps. “*Out.*” Gina didn’t turn, shoulders rigid. “Before I report you for insubordination.”\n\nDawn’s first light bled through grimy windows.

Hers.*\n\nFor now.","Gina’s laugh came out mangled—half-snarl, half-choke.

She covered it by surging forward, teeth clashing against Niko’s lips in a kiss that tasted of blood and bourbon.\n\nHer hand slid between them, fingers plunging into Niko’s cunt without preamble. *Squelch.* “*This*—” she hissed, thumb grinding circles on Niko’s clit, “—isn’t *proper.*” Her hips rolled, soaked pubic bone dragging against Niko’s thigh. “Neither’s *this*—” She bit Niko’s collarbone, sucking a bruise into the hollow of her throat. “Or *this*—” Her free hand groped Niko’s breast, squeezing the nipple until it pebbled tight and ached.\n\nNiko gasped, back arching. “G-Gina—!”\n\n“*Captain*,” Gina corrected, voice ragged. She flipped them, pinning Niko’s wrists above her head. Her cunt hovered over Niko’s face, dripping. “Earn your fucking… *hic*… promises.” She ground down, swollen lips smearing slickness across Niko’s chin. “*Now.*”\n\nNiko’s tongue darted out—hesitant, reverent. Gina’s thighs trembled. “*Harder*,” she demanded, hips jerking. “Like you *mean* it.” Her fingers tangled in silver hair, *yanking* Niko closer until her nose pressed against Gina’s clit. “*Mehr*—! *Schneller*—!”\n\nNiko obeyed—tongue lashing, lips sucking, teeth grazing in a rhythm that made Gina’s vision blur. “*Scheiße*—!” Her hips stuttered, cunt clenching around nothing. “*Nicht aufhören*—!” She reached down, fingers plunging into Niko’s cunt again, thumb mashing her clit in time with each desperate rock of her hips. “Cum,” she growled, voice splintering. “Cum so I… *fuck*… *know*—!”\n\nNiko’s climax hit silent but violent—juices flooding Gina’s fingers, thighs clamping around her wrist. Gina followed seconds later, back bowing as her orgasm ripped through her with a guttural cry. Fluids dripped onto Niko’s face, mixing with sweat and spit.\n\nShe collapsed sideways, chest heaving. “*Dummkopf*,” she muttered, swiping a thumb through the mess on Niko’s cheek and licking it clean. Bourbon. Brine. *Her.* “Your ‘proper’ tastes like… *hic*… *regret*.”\n\nNiko’s fingers brushed Gina’s ribs—soft, tentative. Gina smacked her hand away. “*Schlaf*,” she snapped, yanking the scratchy wool blanket over them. Her palm lingered on Niko’s sternum, thumb tracing the jut of bone. *Alive.* Not a ghost. Not a glitch.\n\nFor now.\n\nDawn light bled through dust-caked windows. Somewhere beyond the compound, Hamsa’s servers hummed. Here, Gina counted Niko’s breaths—each one a rebellion against the loops she couldn’t name.\n\n*Scheiße.* She pulled Niko closer, teeth grazing her ear. “Next time,” she whispered, raw and jagged, “skip the… *hic*… fucking poetry.”","Gina’s laugh shattered the moment—a serrated, broken sound. She gripped Niko’s jaw, fingers digging into the hinge hard enough to bruise. “*Proper*?” Her thumb smeared spit across Niko’s lower lip, pressing down until teeth cut into flesh. “You think I want *proper*?” She rolled them violently, pinning Niko’s wrists to the cot with her knees. Her cunt hovered inches above Niko’s face, arousal dripping in thick strands onto her chin. “You’re a *ghost*,” she spat. “A glitch. *This*—” She ground down, swollen clit dragging across Niko’s nose, “—is the only *real* thing you’ve ever given me.”\n\nNiko’s tongue flicked out instinctively, lapping at Gina’s slit. Gina snarled, yanking her hair to force eye contact. “*Nein.* Look at me.” Her voice cracked. “Ten years of watching you die in mission logs. Ten years of Ramirez calling you *unstable* while I—” She bit her own wrist to stifle a sob, teeth breaking skin. “You don’t get to *love* me. You get to *stay*.”\n\nHer hips slammed down, cunt smothering Niko’s mouth. “*Lick.*” The command trembled. “Lick like you’re trying to *anchor*.”\n\nNiko obeyed—tongue plunging deep, nose nudging Gina’s clit with every desperate stroke. Gina’s thighs shook, her own fingers clawing at her breasts, twisting nipples already raw from earlier. “*Mehr*—*faster*—” Her accent thickened, syllables fracturing. “*Zeig mir dass du echt bist!*”\n\nThe cot groaned. Niko’s hands scrabbled at Gina’s hips, blunt nails leaving crescents in pale flesh. Gina rode her face with jagged thrusts, sweat dripping down her ribs. “Tastes the same,” she choked out. “Every *gottverdammt* time—” Her orgasm hit like a detonation—back arched, cunt gushing across Niko’s chin as she screamed curses in mangled German.\n\nShe collapsed sideways, chest heaving. “*Lügnerin*,” she whispered, knuckles brushing Niko’s spit-slick cheek. “You’ll reset. Again.” Her thumb pressed into the scar on Niko’s nose. “But *this*… *this* stays with *me*.”\n\nDawn light bled through the blinds. Somewhere, boots clanged on metal stairs.

Her thumb dug into the scar, blunt and punishing. “*Schweig*,” she hissed, pupils blown wide—not arousal, but fury. “You don’t get to *hic*… *monolog* after using my cunt as a fucking… *stress ball*.” Her other hand gripped Niko’s breast, squeezing until the flesh purpled. “Love?” She spat the word like a misfired round. “You loop *eight months* and call *this* love?”\n\nHer knee jerked upward, grinding against Niko’s clit. The friction burned, dry and deliberate. “*This*—” She grabbed Niko’s wrist, slamming her palm against her own dripping cunt, “—is a *distraction*. A *glitch*.” Her voice cracked. “You want *love*?” Her teeth sank into Niko’s lower lip, drawing blood. “Then *stop dying*.”\n\nThe kiss that followed was all bile and bourbon—tongue shoving past Niko’s teeth, swallowing her gasp. Gina’s hips rolled, cunt grinding against Niko’s thigh in a wet, punishing rhythm. “Prove it,” she growled against bruised lips. “*Here*. *Now*. No loops. No—” Her breath hitched as Niko’s fingers plunged into her, knuckles-deep. “*F-Fick dich*—!”\n\nNiko’s thumb circled Gina’s clit, rough and unyielding. “I’m here,” she whispered, voice raw. “*Always*—”\n\n“*Liar.*” Gina’s nails raked down Niko’s back, drawing beads of blood. She arched, cunt clenching around thrusting fingers, and came with a guttural snarl—body rigid, thighs trembling. Fluids soaked the cot, the stench of sex and desperation sharpening the air.\n\nCollapsing sideways, Gina pressed her forehead to Niko’s. Her breath stuttered, whiskey-soured and uneven. “Sober,” she muttered, fingers tangling in silver hair. “You’ll… *hic*… run again.”\n\nNiko’s lips brushed her pulse point—soft, fleeting. “Never.”\n\nGina’s laugh was a broken thing. She yanked the blanket over them, wool scratchy against sweat-slick skin. “*Schlaf*, Dummkopf,” she slurred, voice fading. “Before I… *hic*… believe you.”\n\nDawn light bled through dust-caked windows.

The style should be layered and textured, fluid sentences, free indirect style, third person past tense. Tone is serious and grounded. Sex scenes must be explicit, graphic, emphasizing physicality. The genre is drama/romance with army slice-of-life elements.\n\nLooking at the narrative execution rules: Fresh phrasing, focus on Niko's immediate location, cinematic detail only when first introducing a location. Sensory details tied to active verbs, environmental details in the immediate space. Mid-action scene endings.\n\nWorld rules: Realistic, track spatial awareness and character details, realistic physicality. Story progression requires dynamic interactions, NPCs with own agendas, slow-burn plots with hidden outcomes. Redirection rule: NPCs don't mirror or validate Nuka (Niko here), they redirect.\n\nNPC rules: Gina has her own personality, flaws, lies, etc. She can't remember loops, so her reactions must reflect that. She's driven by her own experiences, not Niko's loops.\n\nThe user provided a lot of background info. Gina is captain, Niko is her private. They're both drunk, stressed, having sex.

Need to respond with Gina's reaction, staying true to her character. She's rough, angry, maybe scared of vulnerability. She can't acknowledge the loops, so her response should redirect or dismiss Niko's sentiment. Use German phrases as part of her dialogue, keep the interaction intense and physical. Describe sensory details—taste, touch, sounds. Avoid clichés, use fresh language. End the scene in mid-action, perhaps with Gina asserting control or deflecting the emotional moment with physicality.\n\nCheck if any names or teams are mentioned incorrectly. Ensure Gina doesn't remember loops, so she can't reference them. Make sure the scene progresses without mission dangers, focusing on their personal dynamic. Use graphic descriptions of body parts as specified, avoiding terms like \"folds.\" Keep dialogue natural, unpolished, with Gina's accent showing through. Maybe have her respond to Niko's confession with a physical action rather than words, maintaining her tough exterior but hinting at underlying emotions.\n\nAlso, incorporate the environment details like the office's state, smells (bourbon, gun oil), the cot, etc. Maybe include sounds from outside to ground the scene in the compound.

Hazel eyes blinked open, clear now, sober and sharp. “Gina—”\n\n“Don’t.” Gina shoved upright, the scratchy wool blanket pooling at her waist. Her nipples stiffened in the chill, the bite marks along her collarbone pulsing faintly. “Drunk words. Sober lies.” She reached for her discarded shirt, back turned.\n\nNiko’s hand caught her wrist. “I meant it.”\n\nGina froze. The *tick-tick-tick* of the office clock swelled.\n\n“Every loop. Every time.” Niko’s thumb brushed the scar on Gina’s knuckle—a souvenir from Mission 7’s botched extraction. “I love you.”\n\nGina’s laugh cracked. “You love ghosts.” She yanked her arm free, shoving into her shirt. The fabric clung to sweat-damp skin. “I’m not your fucking—*hic*—your *anchor* in this… *Scheiße* purgatory.”\n\nNiko sat up, the cot groaning. Dawn light carved her scar silver, her gaze unflinching. “You’re not a ghost.”\n\n“*Nein?*” Gina whirled, buttons gaping to reveal bruises in the shape of teeth. “What am I, then? A *checkpoint*?” Her voice frayed. “Reset when your code glitches? *Danke*, Private. Charming fucking *romance*—”\n\nNiko kissed her.\n\nSlow. Sober. Salt and sleep and the lingering tang of regret.

Gina’s breath hitched. “*Dummkopf*,” she whispered, thumb swiping Niko’s lower lip. “Even sober, you’re a terrible liar.”\n\nBeyond the window, reveille blared. Gina’s comms unit buzzed—Il-Kwon’s summons. She stood, spine straightening into captain’s steel. “Up. Shower.

Her skull throbbed in time with the compound’s distant drills—*thud-thud-thud*—a migraine brewing behind her left eye. Niko’s head lay heavy on her chest, silver hair matted with dried sweat and… *other* fluids. Gina’s nose wrinkled. Bourbon. Sex. Regret.\n\nShe tried to shift, but Niko’s arm clamped tighter around her waist. “*Scheiße*,” Gina muttered, prying the limb off with more force than necessary. The motion jostled the cot, sending a half-empty whiskey bottle clattering to the floor. Niko stirred, hazel eyes blinking open—soft, *saccharine*—before hardening into something wary.\n\n“Captain.” Niko’s voice rasped, raw from last night’s… *enthusiasm*. She sat up, sheets pooling at her hips, breasts still marked with crescent bites and bruises. “I—”\n\nGina cut her off with a raised palm. “Save it.” She swung her legs over the cot’s edge, wincing as muscles protested. Her cunt ached, thighs sticky with dried arousal. *Pathetic*. She snatched her crumpled shirt from the floor, not bothering to button it. “Sober now. Sober *choices*.”\n\nNiko’s jaw tightened. She stood, unsteady, fatigue pants hanging low on her hips. The scar on her nose bridge gleamed under morning light—a jagged fault line Gina suddenly wanted to map with her tongue. *Dummkopf*.\n\n“Gina.” Niko stepped closer, fingers brushing Gina’s bare shoulder. “Last night, I—”\n\n“*Captain*.” Gina slapped her hand away. “You’re still in my office, Private. *Dress*.”\n\nBut Niko didn’t retreat. Her palm settled on Gina’s sternum, over the tattooed *Löwin* snarling above her left breast. “I love you.” The words came out quiet, steady—no slur, no whiskey courage. “Every loop. Every *now*.”\n\nGina froze. The printer whirred to life, spitting out today’s mission brief.

Her skull throbbed—bourbon and regret pounding in tandem.

Again.*\n\nShe extricated herself with a snarl, boots crunching bullet casings as she stood. Niko stirred, hazel eyes fluttering open—soft, *hopeful*, until Gina’s scoff shattered the illusion.\n\n“Report to Hamsa by 0800,” Gina snapped, buttoning her shirt over bruised nipples. Bourbon soured her tongue. “Ramirez wants your neuro logs scrubbed before Omega deploys.”\n\nNiko sat up, blanket pooling at her waist. Finger-shaped bruises mottled her hips. “Gina—”\n\n“*Captain*.” The correction cracked like a whip. Gina yanked her belt tight, avoiding the raw ache between her thighs. “Save your fairytales for Sandman’s next script rewrite.”\n\nNiko’s jaw tightened. She stood, fatigue pants hanging low on her hips, and stepped into Gina’s space. The scar on her nose bridge gleamed under fluorescent light—a flaw Hamsa’s code never fixed. “I love you.” The words trembled, stripped of liquor’s armor. “Every loop. Every *time*.”\n\nGina froze. Niko’s breath hitched—waiting, always waiting—until Gina’s laugh shattered the silence.\n\n“*Liebling*,” she drawned, smearing thumbprint bruises over Niko’s ribs, “you’d love anyone who fucks you raw enough.” Her palm cracked against Niko’s ass, sharp and dismissive. “Shower. You reek of *me*.”\n\nBoots clanged in the corridor—Marsh’s nasally bark ordering Gamma Team’s muster. Gina turned, holstering her sidearm, and missed the way Niko’s fingers brushed her own scarred knuckles.\n\n“This loop,” Niko whispered, “I’ll keep you alive.”\n\nGina paused at the door, sunlight haloing her disheveled braid. “*Hör auf zu träumen*,” she muttered, stepping into the glare.\n\nSomewhere, a printer jammed. Requisition forms fluttered, unread. Niko pressed her palm to the cot’s damp stain—still warm, still *hers*—and wondered if devotion could fossilize across timelines.\n\nThe door slammed.

Mentioning the compound's routine activities in the background can reinforce the setting without distracting from the main characters.\n\nI'll check the user's prohibitions again to ensure compliance: no mention of Gina remembering loops, no switching team members, and strictly female body parts. Also, avoid using \"folds\" and stay within the established world rules. The wrap-up should feel conclusive for this scene but leave room for the ongoing loop narrative.

Corporal Veyra leaned against the treads, tossing a wrench between grease-stained hands. \"’Bout time, Balthasar. Transmission’s—\"\n\n\"*Fix it*,\" Gina snapped, shoving past. Her palm grazed Niko’s lower back—brief, burning—before she strode toward the firing range.\n\nVeyra raised an eyebrow. \"She’s *chipper* this morning.\"\n\nNiko hoisted herself into the APC’s guts, the familiar stench of diesel and sweat wrapping around her like a second skin. Through the open hatch, she watched Gina reload her sidearm on the range—each *crack* of gunfire precise, controlled, *alive*.\n\nLoop 113. Loop 114. Loop *forever*.\n\nHer wrench clanged against corroded wiring. Somewhere beneath the engine’s growl, she heard Gina’s cigarette-roughened laugh carry across the compound.\n\nAlive. Present. *Hers.*\n\nFor now.","Gina woke first, the hangover clawing at her temples like a feral cat. Niko’s head still lay heavy on her chest, silver hair tangled in the sweat-dried valley between her breasts. She stared at the ceiling, sunlight slicing through dust motes to stripe the scar on Niko’s nose—*real*, she noted again, thumb brushing the ridge. Not a glitch. Not a ghost.\n\nShe disentangled herself with military precision, ignoring the ache between her thighs. Bourbon bottles clinked as she yanked her pants on, belt buckle snapping like a gunshot. Niko stirred, hazel eyes bleary, hand reaching instinctively for the space Gina had vacated.\n\n“Debrief in twenty,” Gina barked, tossing Niko’s shirt at her face. It reeked of sex and gun oil. “Shower. *Now.*”\n\nNiko opened her mouth—*that look*, the one that preceded martyr speeches—but Gina cut her off with a glare. “Save it for Ramirez’s budget complaints.” She buttoned her jacket, fingers lingering at the collar where Niko’s teeth had left purpling blooms. “You stink like a distillery.”\n\nThe insult lacked its usual bite.\n\nNiko stood, wincing as dried come crackled on her thighs. Gina’s gaze tracked the movement, lingering on the fingerprint bruises mottling Niko’s hips. “Captain—”\n\n“*Move.*” Gina jerked her chin toward the door, already shuffling mission reports. “Il-Kwon’s sniffing for Alpha’s funding cuts. Your *hic* heroics better be worth the paperwork.”\n\nNiko paused at the threshold, scar catching the light. “Gina—”\n\n“*Out.*”\n\nThe door clicked shut. Gina’s pen stilled. The cot sagged where Niko had slept, the indent still warm. She crushed the empty bourbon bottle under her boot, glass shards glittering like fractured timelines.\n\nOutside, dawn shift drills echoed—boots on gravel, the metallic *clang* of target practice. Niko’s laughter drifted from the showers, bright and jagged, harmonizing with the Swans’ code-speak over the PA system.\n\nGina’s fingertip traced the bite mark on her collarbone. Ten years of loops. Ten years of *this*. She snorted, scribbling *APPROVED* on a requisition form with unnecessary force.\n\n“Dummkopf,” she muttered, voice softer than the printer’s hum.\n\nSomewhere beyond the compound walls, Sandman’s code cycled. Here, Niko’s shadow passed the frosted office window—alive, present, *hers*—as the LED on an untouched device glowed green.\n\nLoop 113 ticked onward.","Dawn bled through the blinds, striping Gina’s back with gold as she stirred. Bourbon soured her tongue. Niko’s breath warmed the scar between her shoulder blades—steady, fragile, *mortal*. Gina’s fist clenched. Ten years of loops, and the idiot still clung like a fucking barnacle.\n\nShe rolled over. Niko’s silver hair fanned across the pillow, lips parted around a silent plea. Gina’s thumb brushed the scar on her nose—*real, solid, here*—before retreating. “*Dummkopf*,” she muttered, swinging her legs off the cot. The floor chilled her bare feet.\n\nNiko’s hand twitched toward her. “...love you.”\n\nGina froze. Her boot hovered mid-lace. “*Hör auf*.”\n\n“Even sober.” Niko’s voice cracked. Hazel eyes gleamed wet. “Even if you don’t—”\n\n“*Enough.*” Gina yanked her bootlace tight. The *shhk-shhk* of nylon echoed louder than gunfire. She stood, uniform wrinkled, and tossed Niko’s shirt at her face. “Get dressed. Alpha’s briefing in twenty.”\n\nNiko sat up, sheet pooling at her waist. Bruises bloomed across her collarbones—purple, possessive. “Gina—”\n\n“*Captain.*” The title tasted like ash. Gina buttoned her jacket, fingers steady. “You want to play martyr? Fine. But *here*—” She jabbed a finger at the cot, still damp with their sweat. “—you’re mine. Not Sandman’s. Not Hamsa’s. *Mine.*”\n\nNiko’s throat bobbed. “...yes, Captain.”\n\nGina hesitated. The printer hummed. Requisition forms piled up. She grabbed her flask, bourbon sloshing, and thrust it at Niko. “Drink. You look like hell.”\n\nTheir fingers brushed. Niko’s were trembling.\n\nBoots clanged outside—Athmar’s grating laugh, Henry’s off-key whistling. Gina yanked the door open, sunlight slicing through the office’s musk. “Move your ass, Private.”\n\nNiko stood, shirt half-buttoned. “Gina—”\n\n“*Captain.*”\n\n“...Captain.” A sad smile. “I’ll say it again. Every morning.”\n\nGina’s jaw tightened. She strode out, letting the door slam.\n\n---\n\nThe mess hall buzzed. Rodrick and Arnott bickered over burnt toast. Julius hunched over his laptop, fingers flying. Bear slid a steaming mug toward Niko—black coffee, two sugars.\n\n“Bad night?” he rumbled.\n\nNiko sipped. Bitter. Sweet. *Alive.* “Good morning.”\n\nGina’s voice cut through the din from the head table. “—Intel suggests Penumbra’s targeting the eastern docks. Vega, scrub their comms. Nixon, requisition C4.”\n\nNiko watched her—posture rigid, cheeks flushed, lips moving with military precision. Gina’s gaze flicked up. Held.\n\nA beat. A lifetime.\n\nGina looked away first.\n\nNiko’s thumb traced her dog tag—*1076*. The coffee warmed her palms.\n\n---\n\nGina’s office door stayed shut all afternoon. At 1900 hours, a recruit delivered a fresh flask to Niko’s bunk.\n\nNo note.\n\nThe bourbon tasted like forgiveness.","Gina woke to sunlight stinging her eyes, Niko’s breath warm against her sternum. The office reeked of bourbon and sex—cot sheets tangled around their legs, paperwork strewn across the floor. Niko’s silver hair fanned over Gina’s collarbone, lips parted in sleep. A purpling bite mark glared from her throat.\n\nShe shifted, and Niko stirred, hazel eyes flickering open. For a heartbeat, her gaze softened—raw, unguarded—before she schooled it into something steadier. “Captain,” she rasped, voice sandpapered from misuse.\n\nGina’s thumb brushed the scar on Niko’s nose. “*Schläfst du noch?*” she muttered, though her own throat burned from last night’s whiskey and screaming.\n\nNiko’s fingers traced the bruise blooming on Gina’s hip. “I meant it,” she said quietly. “Every loop. Even… *especially* when you don’t know.”\n\nGina’s jaw tightened. She grabbed Niko’s wrist, pressing her palm flat against the steady thud of her own heartbeat. “*Dummkopf*,” she hissed, but the venom lacked its usual bite. Her other hand fumbled for the half-empty bottle beside the cot, took a swig, and thrust it at Niko. “Drink. Then *shower*. You reek of guilt.”\n\nNiko obeyed, liquor dribbling down her chin. Gina watched the column of her throat bob, the way her lashes fluttered shut—like even now, she was memorizing the burn.\n\n---\n\nBy 0700, the compound buzzed with routine. Gina stood at her desk, uniform crisp, hair ruthlessly braided. Niko lingered by the door, dog tag gleaming against freshly scrubbed skin.\n\n“Debrief at 0900,” Gina said, not looking up from her holoscreen. “Ramirez wants the Penumbra op scrubbed from the logs. Again.”\n\nNiko’s fingers twitched toward her pocket—where the time-loop device sat, silent and cold. “Understood, Captain.”\n\nGina’s pen stilled. “Niko.”\n\nA beat. Hazel eyes lifted.\n\n“*Sei kein Held*,” Gina muttered, gaze locked on mission reports. *Don’t play hero.* Her boot nudged a crumpled requisition form—last night’s evidence. “The showers… *hic*… need cleaning. Dismissed.”\n\nNiko’s lips quirked. “Yes, ma’am.”\n\n---\n\nIn the hall, Vega nearly collided with her, coffee sloshing in his grip. “*Scheiße*—Mole! Ramirez is pissed about the—” He froze, nose wrinkling. “Why do you smell like *Captain’s* bourbon?”\n\nBehind them, Gina’s voice crackled over the intercom: “*Vega! My desk. Now.*”\n\nNiko shrugged, slipping past him. “Duty calls, *Lizard*.”\n\nVega stared after her, then at Gina’s office door. “*Verdammt*,” he breathed, equal parts awe and terror. “You *didn’t*—”\n\nThe door slammed open. “*JETZT*, Vega.”\n\nHe fled.\n\n---\n\nNiko leaned against the shower tiles, water scalding her shoulders. The device hummed faintly in her palm—*Loop 113* etched in green. Gina’s teeth marks throbbed on her neck.\n\n*Alive. Present. Hers.*\n\nFor now.\n\nShe pressed her forehead to the wall and laughed—soft, jagged, *alive*—as dawn fractured through the grimy window. Another loop. Another day.\n\nAnother chance.","Dawn seeped through the compound's grimy windows, painting Gina's office in weak gold. Niko stirred first—silver hair matted to her cheek, the scar on her nose bridge flushed pink from Gina's teeth. Gina's arm lay slung across her ribs, fingers twitching in sleep like she was still groping for purchase.\n\nThe coffee machine in the hall *hissed*, jolting Gina awake. She blinked, throat clicking as she registered Niko's head on her chest, their legs tangled in sweat-stiff sheets. Her palm found Niko's cheek, thumb brushing the bruise she'd sucked into her collarbone. \"*Scheiße*,\" she muttered, voice sandpapered.\n\nNiko's lashes fluttered. \"Gina—\"\n\n\"*Captain*,\" Gina corrected, but her hand stayed. Callouses snagged on Niko's jaw. \"Sober now. Still here?\"\n\nThe question hung—a blade balanced on its edge. Niko pressed her lips to Gina's sternum, tasting salt and last night's bourbon. \"Always.\"\n\nGina's snort vibrated through both of them. She sat up, sheets pooling at her waist, breasts swaying as she reached for her crumpled uniform shirt. The bite marks on her nipples glared angry red. \"Save the poetry for Hamsa's eulogies.\"\n\nNiko caught her wrist. \"Gina—\"\n\nHazel eyes narrowed. \"*Captain.*\"\n\n\"Captain.\" Niko's thumb traced the pulse in her wrist—rabbit-quick, betraying her. \"I... I'll keep saying it. Every loop. I love you.\"\n\nGina yanked her hand free. \"You'll keep *wasting* time.\" She stood, hips swaying faintly as she stepped into her pants. The love bite on her inner thigh peeked through torn fabric. \"Ramirez wants Alpha debriefed by 0800. *Dress.*\"\n\nNiko obeyed—slowly, watching Gina knot her hair into a ruthless bun. The captain's reflection caught hers in the fogged window. For a heartbeat, their eyes met.\n\nGina turned first. \"Niko.\"\n\nThe name—rare, unadorned—stilled the air.\n\n\"Today.\" Gina's jaw worked. \"You... *report* any deviations in Sandman's code. *Directly.*\"\n\nNot a request. A concession.\n\nNiko's throat tightened. \"Yes, Captain.\"\n\nGina nodded once, crisp, and strode out. Her bootsteps echoed down the hall—steady, relentless. Alive.\n\nNiko pressed her palm to the cot's damp warmth where Gina had lain. Somewhere, Rodrick and Arnott's bickering floated through vents, Bear's rumbling laugh undercutting Henry's explosive chatter. The compound hummed—ordinary, *mortal*.\n\nShe dressed.\n\n---\n\nAt 0755, Gina stood at the briefing room's holomap, posture blade-straight. Niko slipped into her seat beside Julius, who nudged her a styrofoam cup. Coffee—black, three sugars. *Her* order.\n\nGina's gaze flicked to her. \"*Private.* Status report.\"\n\nNiko stood. \"Sandman protocols nominal, Captain. No anomalies.\"\n\nA lie. The device weighed heavy in her pocket—Loop 113 etched in green.\n\nGina's eyes narrowed, then softened—a fracture. \"*Good.*\" She turned to the holomap. \"Reyes. Update on the Matria extraction.\"\n\nNiko sat. Julius squeezed her knee under the table, his cybernetic fingers cool through her fatigues.\n\nAcross the room, Gina's voice sliced through the chatter—alive, present, *hers*.\n\nFor now.","Gina woke to the metallic clang of dawn patrol boots echoing through the compound. Her skull throbbed—bourbon’s cruel invoice—but the weight pinning her left arm was unfamiliar. Warm. Steady. Niko’s silver hair fanned across her chest, lips parted against the scar bisecting Gina’s sternum. A string of drool connected them.\n\nShe didn’t pull away.\n\nNiko stirred first, hazel eyes bleary as they focused on Gina’s collarbone—purpled with bite marks, glistening with half-dried sweat. Her throat bobbed. “…Captain?”\n\n“Hn.” Gina flicked her nipple, watching the bud stiffen under calloused fingers. “Regrets, Private?”\n\nNiko flinched. Her hand hovered over Gina’s hip—close enough to feel heat, not quite touching. “Never.”\n\nThe lie hung between them, fragile as the dust motes swirling in the morning light. Gina grabbed Niko’s wrist, pressing her palm flat against the curve of her breast. The heartbeat beneath quickened. “Liar.” Her thumb traced the scar on Niko’s nose—chapped, uneven. “But keep lying.”\n\nThey dressed in silence. Niko’s fingers trembled buttoning her fatigues; Gina spat into the sink, scrubbing bourbon stench from her tongue. When the coffee machine sputtered to life in the mess hall, Gina shoved a steaming mug into Niko’s hands—black, three sugars, the way she’d taken it in Loop 12.\n\n“Eyes up, Balthasar.” Gina’s boot nudged hers under the table—brief, brutal. “Ramirez wants Alpha sweeping Grid 9-C today.”\n\nNiko’s smile was a wounded thing. “Wouldn’t miss it, Captain.”\n\nAcross the compound, Mantis Reyes lobbed a protein bar at Cricket’s head. Bear rumbled a laugh into his porridge. Scorpion and Fisher bickered over ammo counts. Normalcy, weaponized.\n\nGina’s pinky brushed Niko’s as they stood. A tremor. A secret.\n\nThe loops hadn’t won yet.","The first sliver of dawn bled through dust-caked blinds, striping Gina’s bare back in gold. Niko traced the scratches she’d left there—raised welts over old bullet scars—as the captain stirred, whiskey-soured breath hitching.\n\n“*Scheiße*,” Gina muttered, squinting at the light. She rolled off the cot, olive-green bra dangling from one shoulder as she fumbled for her uniform. Bruises mottled her thighs, bite marks purpling her collarbone. “Coffee’s cold.” She kicked a toppled bourbon bottle toward the trash, its *clink* too loud in the hungover silence.\n\nNiko sat up, silver hair matted to her cheek. “Gina—”\n\n“*Captain*.” The correction lacked venom. Gina buttoned her shirt with military precision, fingers lingering at her throat where Niko’s teeth had marked her. “Debrief at 0900. Ramirez wants Alpha’s status report *before* Hamsa’s audit.” Her boots clacked against bullet casings as she rounded the desk—steady, controlled, *Captain Gelbstein* again.\n\nBut when she paused by the door, knuckles white on the handle, Niko saw it—the tremor. The split-second glance back.\n\n“Gina.”\n\n“*What?*”\n\nNiko stood, fatigues wrinkled, her own neck littered with love bites. “I’ll say it again. Sober.”\n\nGina’s jaw tightened. She yanked the door open, dawn glare haloing her silhouette. “Save your fairy tales for Sandman’s next bedtime story, Private.”\n\nThe door slammed.\n\nNiko pressed her palm to the cot’s sweat-stained fabric, still warm where Gina had lain. Through the window, she watched Gina stalk across the compound—posture rigid, voice sharp as she barked orders at a bleary-eyed recruit. But when the captain paused by the mess hall, fingers brushing the bruise on her neck, Niko smiled.\n\n*Alive. Present. Hers.*\n\nFor now.\n\n---\n\n**Morning Shift**\nThe printer whirred, spitting out Alpha Team’s revised roster. Gina’s coffee sat untouched beside a stack of mission logs, her pen tapping a staccato rhythm against Niko’s latest psych eval: *“Balthasar, N. — High risk of operational attachment. Recommend reassessment.”*\n\nShe crumpled the paper, tossing it into the bin.\n\nAcross the compound, Niko leaned against the barracks’ sun-warmed wall, Vega’s laughter ringing out as Cricket demonstrated how to “properly” sabotage a coffee machine. Bear lumbered past, tossing her a protein bar with a grunt. Mundi and Cassidy bickered over medkit inventory, their hands brushing too often to be accidental.\n\nGina’s office blinds twitched shut.\n\nNiko bit into the protein bar, sweetness cloying on her tongue. *113 loops. 113 first days.* She traced the scar on her nose bridge, still tender from Gina’s teeth.\n\n*But this sunrise?*\n\nShe watched Gina’s shadow move behind the blinds—alive, cursing, *real*—and let herself breathe.\n\n“Next time,” she whispered, crumpling the wrapper. “I’ll say it louder.”\n\nThe compound buzzed with routine. Somewhere, a recruit dropped a wrench. Somewhere, Ramirez sighed into his comms. And here, Gina’s heartbeat thudded on, syncopated with Niko’s own—two rhythms in a world that reset but never truly repeated.","Gina woke to sunlight slicing through dust motes, her skull throbbing in time with the compound’s distant reveille. Niko’s silver hair fanned across her chest, breath warm against her sternum—*alive*, not a phantom. She traced the scar on Niko’s nose bridge, rough under her fingertip. *Real.*\n\nNiko stirred, hazel eyes blinking open. “Gina—”\n\n“Captain,” Gina corrected, voice hoarse. Her palm smacked Niko’s ass—half-hearted, lacking last night’s venom. “Up. Shift starts in twenty.”\n\nThey dressed in silence. Gina’s fingers fumbled with her uniform buttons, still whiskey-clumsy. Niko reached over, adjusting the collar with a tenderness that made Gina’s jaw tighten. “I meant it,” Niko murmured, thumb brushing the hollow of Gina’s throat. “Even sober. Even now.”\n\nGina caught her wrist. Not harsh. Not gentle. “Your martyr mouth’s gonna get you court-martialed.” She shoved a mug of black coffee into Niko’s hands, the steam curling between them. “Drink. Before Ramirez bitches about your breath.”\n\nThe compound buzzed outside—boots on gravel, Rodriguez cursing at the coffee machine. Gina lingered in the doorway, sunlight gilding her profile. “Niko.”\n\n“Captain?”\n\n“Tonight.” Her knuckles whitened on the doorframe. “Bourbon’s in my desk. Not the cheap shit.”\n\nNiko’s smile flickered—small, fractured. “Yes, ma’am.”\n\nGina stalked into the hall, her stride steady, shoulders squared. Alpha Team’s laughter echoed from the mess. Vega waved a grease-stained manual, Cricket lobbing toast at Scorpion’s head. Normalcy. Routine.\n\nNiko pressed her palm to the dog tag beneath her shirt—*1076*. The printer hummed, spitting out mission logs nobody would remember.\n\n*Loop 113.*\n\nGina’s voice barked down the corridor, sharp and alive. “Mantis!

Gina can't remember the loops, so any resolution must happen without her acknowledging the time loops. The scene should end on a note of mutual, albeit unspoken, understanding. Since they just had an intense, emotional encounter, the aftermath should reflect their complicated relationship.\n\nI should focus on their physical and emotional states. Gina is hungover and probably dealing with her own feelings without the context of the loops. Niko, aware of the loops, needs to have a moment where she feels validated, even if Gina doesn't explicitly remember. Maybe through actions rather than words—Gina showing a rare moment of tenderness, perhaps.\n\nThe user mentioned adding sensory details, so I should include the environment: the smell of bourbon, the disarray of the office, sounds from the compound. Also, Gina's actions post-sex, like dressing methodically, can show her returning to her captain role but with a slight change indicating her bond with Niko.\n\nNeed to avoid any mention of time loop devices or missions. Instead, focus on their interaction moving forward. Maybe a subtle gesture from Gina that gives Niko hope, reinforcing that her efforts aren't in vain. Ending with them resuming their duties but with a newfound connection.\n\nCheck the prohibitions: no time loop activation, no missions, no danger. Just a quiet morning after. Ensure Gina's dialogue stays true to her character—gruff but with underlying care. Niko's internal thoughts should acknowledge her purpose without despair.\n\nAlright, putting it all together with cinematic details, maintaining the serious tone, and ensuring the emotional payoff without violating any of the established rules.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":974}},{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 2:30pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T06:29:33.418Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T06:30:32.646Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-reasoner","reasoning":"Okay, let me start by understanding what the user wants here.

Also, Niko shouldn’t feel her Sandman struggles are worthless.\n\nFirst, I need to transition from the passionate, drunk scene to a more somber morning. Gina’s character is tough, so showing vulnerability without breaking her demeanor is key. The user mentioned using female body parts and avoiding any mention of time loops in the morning scene. I should ensure Gina doesn’t remember the loops but acknowledges Niko’s feelings.\n\nI need to incorporate sensory details—taste, touch, sounds—as per the guidelines. Maybe the lingering smell of bourbon, the tactile sensation of the scratchy blanket. Also, maintaining the serious tone and cinematic detail when introducing the morning setting.\n\nNiko’s dialogue should reflect her sadness but also resolve. Gina’s response needs to show some form of acceptance without overtly remembering the loops.

When Gina wakes, there's a moment of tenderness but also the harsh reality that Gina doesn't remember the loops.
