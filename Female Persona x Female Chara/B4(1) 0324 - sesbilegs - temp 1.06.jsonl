She hooked her fingers in the fabric and yanked, peeling them down Gina’s thighs in one rough motion.\n\nGina’s cunt was slick, glistening in the low light, and Niko didn’t hesitate—she licked a broad stripe from entrance to clit, savoring the way Gina *jolted*, thighs clamping around her head.\n\n“*Nicht so schnell—!*” Gina gasped, but Niko ignored her, circling her clit with the flat of her tongue before sinking two fingers inside without warning. Gina *shrieked*, back arching off the bed as Niko fucked her with quick, brutal thrusts.\n\n“You *remember*,” Niko snarled against her thigh, fingers curling just right to make Gina’s hips stutter. “You *fucking* remember how many times I had to watch—”\n\nGina came with a sob, cunt clenching around Niko’s fingers like a vise.

The mattress creaked under their weight as she pinned Niko beneath her, one hand splayed possessively over her stomach. \"You’re *mine*,\" she breathed, dragging her tongue up the column of Niko’s throat. \"Not the loops, not Falkos, not the fucking Sandman program—*mine*.\"\n\nNiko arched into her touch, nails raking down Gina’s bare back. \"H-hah... am I?\"\n\nGina didn’t hesitate. She yanked Niko’s pants down past her hips, mouth watering at the sight of her—pale thighs trembling, cunt glistening, clit swollen and begging for attention.

She could feel every flick of Gina’s tongue, every sinful drag of lips and teeth, the way her captain moaned like *she* was the one being devoured.\n\nGina pulled back just enough to smirk up at her, chin slick. \"You taste like gunpowder and cheap gin,\" she murmured, thumb circling Niko’s clit in lazy strokes. \"Perfect.\"\n\nNiko’s hips jerked, a broken whimper tearing from her throat. \"Gina—*please*—\"\n\nThe captain didn’t make her beg twice.

But her hand fisted in the sheets beside Niko’s hip, knuckles whitening.\n\nNiko pressed a kiss to the crown of her head, tasting salt and gunmetal. \"S’okay,\" she murmured. \"I won’t ask.\"\n\nGina’s breath hitched—just once. Then she was surging up, capturing Niko’s mouth in a kiss that tasted like grief and gin and something too close to *thanks.* Her teeth caught Niko’s lower lip, biting down just hard enough to sting before pulling away.\n\n\"*Dummkopf,*\" she muttered again, but there was no heat left in it. Just weariness. Just *her.*\n\nOutside, the base alarms wailed—another drill, another false alarm. Gina didn’t so much as flinch. She just slumped back against Niko’s chest, her breathing already deepening toward sleep.\n\nNiko kept humming.\n\nThe lights flickered.

The captain's calloused hands slid down Niko's sweat-slick back, blunt nails leaving faint red trails over old bullet grazes and knife scars (Loop 27, 41, 58—).\n\n\"*Meine betrunkene kleine Sandmaus,*\" Gina murmured, the Saneran endearment rough with sleep and liquor. Her thumbs hooked into the waistband of Niko's ruined briefs, yanking them down with a wet *snap* where they'd stuck to her thighs. The air between them reeked of sex and gin, of gun oil and the ozone tang of Falkos' failing climate control.\n\nNiko's breath hitched when Gina's palm cupped her bare cunt, fingers sliding through slick heat with the same efficiency she reloaded her sidearm—practiced, effortless. \"*G-Gina—!*\"\n\nThe captain's free hand clamped over Niko's mouth, stifling her moan. \"*Leise,*\" she growled, hazel eyes glinting in the emergency lights. \"Walls are thin. Scorpion's bunk's right—*ah!*—right fucking across.\" Her hips rolled up, grinding her swollen clit against Niko's thigh as two fingers plunged deep without warning.\n\nNiko's back arched, her scream muffled by Gina's palm. The captain's cunt was sopping against her leg, hot enough to brand. Gina fucked into her own fist with the same relentless rhythm she used to clear rooms—short, controlled thrusts that punched the air from Niko's lungs.\n\n\"*Siehst du?*\" Gina panted, her breath coming in ragged bursts. Her thumb found Niko's clit, rubbing tight circles that made stars burst behind her eyelids. \"Still *here.* Still *real.*\" The words were half-snarled, half-plea, her Saneran accent fracturing around the edges.\n\nNiko came with a strangled sob, her cunt clamping down hard enough to make Gina hiss. The captain rode out her orgasm with ruthless precision, fingers working through each shuddering pulse until Niko went boneless against her chest.\n\nGina's own release followed seconds later—a sharp, bitten-off groan as she ground against Niko's thigh, her cunt fluttering around nothing. Spent, she collapsed atop Niko, their sweat-slick bodies sticking together in the humid air.\n\nOutside, the distant *thrum* of a patrol drone buzzed past the barracks. Somewhere down the hall, Scorpion's raucous laughter echoed through thin walls.\n\nGina's lips brushed Niko's ear, her voice barely audible over the hum of failing climate control: \"*Nächste Runde... kauf besseren Gin.*\"\n\nNext round... buy better gin.\n\nNiko's laughter was muffled against Gina's shoulder, bright and broken and alive.","The emergency lights flickered in a slow, arrhythmic pulse—red washing over sweat-slicked skin, then darkness, then red again. Gina's breath evened against Niko's collarbone, her body a dead weight atop the private's smaller frame. The scent of sex and gun oil clung to them both, thick enough to taste.\n\nNiko's fingers trailed absently through Gina's braid, unraveling the strands damp with exertion. The captain stirred, a low grunt vibrating against Niko's sternum as she nosed deeper into the crook of her neck.\n\n\"*Mmm.* Stop that,\" Gina muttered, voice slurry with exhaustion and residual liquor. Her thigh, still wedged between Niko's, twitched—a half-hearted attempt to shift away, but she didn't have the energy to disentangle.\n\nNiko hummed, the sound reverberating through her chest. The tune was old—something half-remembered from a loop where Gina had sung it drunk off her ass after Mission 3, swaying on her feet in the barracks while the others laughed.\n\nGina stilled. Then, with a roughness that had nothing to do with sleep: \"*...Where the hell did you hear that?*\"\n\nNiko's fingers paused mid-stroke. \"You. Loop forty-two, I think. Maybe forty-three.\" She could still see it—Gina's head thrown back, the column of her throat bared as she belted out the verses, her voice raw and off-key. The way Scorpion had clapped her on the back hard enough to make her choke on the next line.\n\nGina exhaled sharply through her nose. \"*Scheiße.* I haven’t sung that since—\" She cut herself off, jaw tightening.\n\n\"Since your dad?\" Niko ventured softly.\n\nThe captain didn’t answer. But her hand fisted in the sheets beside Niko’s hip, knuckles whitening.\n\nNiko pressed a kiss to the crown of her head, tasting salt and gunmetal. \"S’okay,\" she murmured. \"I won’t ask.\"\n\nGina’s breath hitched—just once.
