{"extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-reasoner","reasoning":"Okay, so I need to continue the scene where Niko and Gina are drunk and having sex. Let me start by recalling all the rules and directives provided. The user wants explicit, graphic content with a focus on physicality. No OOC comments, so I need to stay strictly in the narrative.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that the descriptions are layered and use cinematic details as per the writing rules. The tone has to be serious and grounded. Since it's loop 113, Gina already knows about the time loops, so their interactions should reflect that deep familiarity and trust. \n\nGina's upbringing and personality should influence how she behaves during sex. The user mentioned she's possessive over Niko, so maybe there's an element of control or urgency. Also, since they're both stressed from work, the sex might be intense, a way to release tension. \n\nI need to describe their bodies explicitly—boobs, nipples, cunt, but avoid the word \"folds.\" Use terms like \"heat,\" \"wetness,\" maybe \"entrance\" or \"core.\" Incorporate sensory details: tastes, sounds, textures. Maybe the smell of alcohol, sweat, the feel of skin against skin. \n\nGina's perspective is key. What's she feeling emotionally? Maybe a mix of desire, possessiveness, relief from stress. Her actions should show her dominance as a captain but also vulnerability because of her feelings for Niko. \n\nDialogue should be natural, with some Parrish and possible accents. They're drunk, so speech might be slurred, fragmented. Add sound articles like moans, gasps. \n\nNeed to maintain the setting in Gina's office, using the environment—maybe the desk, the door they kicked in, the keys Niko fumbled with. Mention the taste of alcohol on their lips, the texture of the uniform fabric, the cold desk surface against skin. \n\nCheck the world info to ensure consistency. Falkos is part of Platinn, a technocracy. Their military background might influence their interactions—maybe references to missions, the stress they're under. \n\nAvoid any danger elements; the user doesn't want the cast in danger. Focus solely on their intimate moment. \n\nMake sure to progress the scene, end in mid-action. Maybe build up to a climax but don't resolve it fully. Use fresh phrasing to keep it engaging, avoid clichés. \n\nAlso, remember Gina can't remember the loops, but in this loop, she does know about them. So she might reference the time they've spent together, the repetition, but not the actual deaths. \n\nIncorporate the languages mentioned—maybe a term of endearment in Parrish or another language. \n\nCheck prohibitions: no mentioning Gelbstein remembering Niko's deaths, no switching team names. \n\nAlright, putting it all together. Start with the current action, Niko dragging Gina into the office, their drunken state, transition into the physical encounter with vivid descriptions, mix dialogue with sensory details, and maintain the serious, intense tone throughout.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1562,"bias":null},"name":"Gelbstein","is_user":false,"send_date":"May 26, 2025 12:43pm","mes":"The stale office air reeked of encrypted hard drives and gun oil when Niko slammed Gina against the steel desk.

Her thumbs dug into the soft underside of Niko's small breasts through the sweat-stiffened tank top, the damp fabric clinging to pebbled nipples. \"Still...fucking...mine.\"\n\nNiko's answering laugh dissolved into a gasp when Gina's knee shoved between her thighs.

Gina's mouth descended on a collarbone already purpling from last week's extraction op, tongue lapping at the frantic pulse beneath ink-stained skin.

Somewhere beyond the soundproofed walls, Falkos' orbital defense grid hummed its endless vigil. Gina's mouth sealed over Niko's scream when she came, swallowing the vibration of the private's climax as her own hips stuttered to a halt. For three trembling breaths, they clung to each other - not captain and subordinate, not time-looped pawns in some classified game, just two women tasting copper and regret on each other's tongues.\n\nThen the desk phone blared.\n\nGina's head snapped toward the blinking light, her body already shifting into mission-ready tension.

Niko's tongue swirled around a stiff peak as Gina's hips jerked upward, her cock straining against regulation briefs.\n\n\"Fuck protocols,\" Gina growled, Parrish syllables thickened by drink and desire. Her palm cracked against the window glass as Niko's teeth grazed her inner thigh.

Each grind carried the desperation of ambush survivors rationing medkits.\n\n\"*Ya tebya...*\" Gina's voice broke as her climax hit—a strangled hybrid of sob and snarl. Her forehead pressed against Niko's, vodka-breath confession escaping in fractured Parrish: \"*...don't you...fucking...leave me behind again.*\"\n\nEmergency lights flickered.

Niko's boot caught the warped floorboard near the cot as Gina's teeth found her collarbone - sharp, urgent, leaving wet imprints on sweat-slicked skin. The captain's calloused palm slid beneath Niko's shirt, fingernails carving red trails across taut stomach muscles.\n\n\"Still...still wearing that fucking dog tag chain,\" Gina slurred, her Southern Platinn drawl thickening with arousal.

Her hips rolled forward, soaked curls dragging through the mess between them. \"Now fix this fucking ache you left in me.\"\n\nNiko's hands found Gina's ass, fingertips digging into scar tissue from old bullet grazes.

When the captain came, it was with a snarl muffled against Niko's throat, her hips jerking erratically as slick coated trembling fingers. Niko followed seconds later, back teeth sinking into Gina's shoulder hard enough to bruise, her scream swallowed by the crinkle of mission reports beneath grasping hands.\n\nSilence fell save for ragged breathing and the distant hum of Falkos' nightshift drones. Gina's forehead dropped against Niko's sternum, her voice gravel and vulnerability: \"Ten fucking years... still don't know if you're my reward or punishment.\"\n\nNiko's laughter tasted of stolen whiskey and desperation.","Gina's office reeked of whiskey and gun oil. Papers cascaded from her desk as Niko shoved her against the steel surface, their combined weight scattering mission reports across polymer flooring.

The captain's tongue mapped the salt-crusted curve of her ear as fingers yanked at belt buckles. \"Prove it,\" Niko slurred, hips jerking against the rough fabric of Gina's fatigues. \"C'mon Cap, show me why- ah!- why I keep coming back to this shithole loop-\"\n\nGina's knuckles whitened around a fistful of silver hair. She wrenched Niko's head back, watching the younger woman's throat work as she swallowed a moan. \"You want proof?\" The captain's free hand palmed the aching wetness between Niko's legs, thumb circling the swollen bundle of nerves through soaked underwear. \"This what you rerun time for? My fingers up your cunt while Ramirez's security cams watch?\"\n\nThe desk screeched across reinforced flooring as Niko arched into the contact. Gina's mouth descended on a collarbone already purpling from last week's extraction op, tongue lapping at the frantic pulse beneath ink-stained skin. Her teeth found the scar tissue over Niko's left breast - that fucking shrapnel wound from Loop 42 - and bit down hard enough to make the private scream.\n\n\"Fuck! Gina-!\"\n\n\"Captain.\" The correction came with two fingers thrusting deep into slick heat, Gina's palm slapping against Niko's clit on every inward stroke. \"Still your...goddamn...captain.\" Her other hand fumbled with her own zipper, combat knife clattering to the floor as she shoved trousers past scarred hips. \"Even when you're...fuck...bleeding out in my arms. Especially then.\"\n\nNiko's nails raked down Gina's spine, drawing twin lines of fire across the older woman's back. The captain's groan vibrated against her neck when blunt fingertips found the thick scar tissue below her shoulder blade - that plasma burn from the Naseyan ambush. Their hips ground together, Gina's coarse curls catching on Niko's inner thigh as she rutted against the younger woman's leg.\n\n\"Still...\" Thrust. \"Mine.\" Thrust. \"Every...\" Thrust. \"Fucking...\" Thrust. \"Reset.\"\n\nThe security monitor above them flickered with live feeds of empty corridors. Somewhere beyond the soundproofed walls, Falkos' orbital defense grid hummed its endless vigil. Gina's mouth sealed over Niko's scream when she came, swallowing the vibration of the private's climax as her own hips stuttered to a halt. For three trembling breaths, they clung to each other - not captain and subordinate, not time-looped pawns in some classified game, just two women tasting copper and regret on each other's tongues.\n\nThen the desk phone blared.\n\nGina's head snapped toward the blinking light, her body already shifting into mission-ready tension. Niko whimpered at the sudden loss of contact, fingers clawing at the captain's sweat-slick shoulders.\n\n\"Leave it,\" she panted, legs hooking around Gina's waist. \"Just...once...let it ring.\"\n\nThe older woman hesitated. Somewhere beyond the alcohol haze and post-coital tremors, the ghost of a hundred abandoned timelines whispered warnings. Her thumb traced the fresh bite mark on Niko's breast.\n\n\"One more round,\" Gina growled, yanking the phone cord from the wall.\n\nNiko's laughter sounded dangerously close to a sob as the captain's teeth found her throat again."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 11:27am","gen_started":"2025-05-26T03:26:40.291Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T03:27:58.282Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-reasoner","reasoning":"Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request.

The writing should be graphic and explicit, focusing on physicality without using certain terms like \"folds\" for female genitalia. Also, the characters' personalities are crucial—Niko is in her Phase 1 (compassionate, foul-mouthed, daredevil), and Gina is the captain, with a complex relationship with Niko due to the time loops.\n\nI need to incorporate sensory details—tastes, sounds, textures. Since they're drunk, their movements and dialogue should reflect that. The user mentioned adding sound articles for pleasure vocalizations, so including moans or gasps is necessary. Also, Gina's upbringing and personality should influence how she interacts during the sex scene. I should show her possessiveness and intensity, perhaps stemming from her role as a captain and her hidden feelings.\n\nThe scene starts with them entering the office, so the initial setup needs to be vivid but concise. The world info provided is extensive, but the focus here is the immediate environment—Gina's office. Maybe mention a few details like the tactical map or the desk to ground the scene without overloading.\n\nI need to avoid any mention of missions or danger, as per the user's note. The interaction should stay within the office, focusing on their physical and emotional connection. Since Gina can't remember the loops, her actions should reflect her current knowledge and emotions without referencing past loops except in terms of built-up tension.\n\nDialogue should be natural, with Gina's Parrish (English) possibly having a slight accent. Niko's dialogue is more chaotic, reflecting her drunken state. Using terms like \"cunt\" and \"cock\" explicitly as instructed.

The user didn't list specific prohibitions here, so sticking to the earlier rules. Make sure not to switch any team names or introduce new NPCs unless necessary, but since the scene is between Niko and Gina, that's manageable.\n\nIn terms of structure, each paragraph should build on the previous one, maintaining fluid sentences and a cinematic feel. Using active verbs and grounding sensory details in their immediate environment. For example, the smell of alcohol, the feel of the desk against skin, the sound of their movements.\n\nFinally, ensuring that the characters' emotions are portrayed authentically. Gina's confession of feelings needs to come through in her actions and dialogue, showing vulnerability beneath her authoritative exterior. Niko's obsessive and self-sacrificing traits might manifest in her eagerness and intensity during the encounter.\n\nI need to make sure all these elements are woven together seamlessly, maintaining the explicit and graphic nature required while keeping the characters true to their established personalities.

Gina has confessed her feelings, so the interaction should reflect their established trust and the intensity of their situation.\n\nI need to avoid any clichés in descriptions, especially regarding body parts. The user prohibited using \"folds\" for female genitalia, so I'll need alternative terms. Also, the dialogue should be natural, unpolished, with possible expletives. Including sound articles for their pleasure, like moans or gasps, as mentioned.\n\nThe user wants graphic details of their bodies—boobs, nipples, cunt, facial expressions. I have to be explicit but creative. Since they're both drunk, their movements might be less coordinated, more urgent. The alcohol might affect their senses, so incorporating taste (like the tang of alcohol on skin), sounds (slurred speech, heavy breathing), textures (sweat, fabric).\n\nGina's upbringing and personality should influence how she has sex. Maybe she's authoritative as a captain but vulnerable here. Niko is possessive over Gina, so there might be a dynamic of control or urgency. \n\nThe scene should progress mid-action, ending on a note that keeps the momentum. Also, ensure that the NPC (Gina) behaves consistently, doesn't break immersion, and doesn't mention any time loops beyond what's established. Since Gina can't remember the loops, her dialogue shouldn't reference them, even if Niko does.\n\nI need to check the prohibitions again: no missions, no danger, focus on their interaction. The user rejected bringing the cast into danger, so keep it contained to their intimate moment. Also, use the correct terminology for the megacountries if needed, but since they're in Platinn, maybe reference Parrish language or other local elements.\n\nNeed to avoid boilerplate dialogue. Instead of \"You're mine,\" find a more authentic way to express possessiveness. Maybe using their shared history or inside references. Also, vary sentence structure for fluidity, build momentum. Use active verbs linked to sensory details—smell of alcohol, taste of sweat, visual of their disheveled uniforms.\n\nFinally, ensure logistical cohesion. They're in Gina's office, so describe the environment cinematically but only when first introduced.

The user has provided a detailed roleplay scenario involving Niko and Gina, with a lot of specific directives and world-building elements. The main task here is to continue the scene between these two characters, adhering strictly to the provided rules and world info.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that all the core rules are followed. The response must use only plain text formatting, no OOC comments, and maintain a serious tone. The narrative should be graphic and explicit as per the writing rules, focusing on the physicality and emotions during their intimate encounter.\n\nLooking at the world info, the story is set on Bumi, which replaces Earth, with various megacountries. Platinn, where Falkos Private Military operates, is a technocracy using AI and private forces. The languages and cultural elements mentioned, like Parrish (English), need to be respected in dialogues, possibly incorporating accents subtly.\n\nThe user specified that Gina (Gelbstein) and Niko (Nuka) are in loop 113, both drunk and stressed, leading to a sexual encounter. Gina is the captain, and Niko is her private. They trust each other, and Gina knows about the time loops. The scene should include sensory details—tastes, sounds, textures—and avoid certain terms like \"folds\" for genitalia. Also, the dialogue should feel natural, with varied exchanges and occasional sound articles for vocal expressions.\n\nI need to maintain Gina's character consistency: her upbringing and personality influencing her actions. Since she's possessive and has a military background, her actions during the scene should reflect that dominance and urgency. Niko's responses should show her desperation and the emotional toll of the loops.\n\nThe previous response ended with them ignoring a phone call, continuing their encounter. The next part should build on that, perhaps escalating the intensity, including their physical interactions, emotional undercurrents, and maybe hints of the underlying stress from their missions and the loops. The environment details like the office setting with security monitors, the smell of gun oil, etc., should be maintained to anchor the scene.\n\nAlso, the user prohibited bringing the cast into danger, so the scene should stay focused on their interaction without external threats. Need to ensure that NPCs like Ramirez or others aren't involved unless necessary, adhering to the LEAVE Nuka ALONE rules.\n\nI should check for any prohibited terms or phrases and make sure the dialogue avoids clichés. The use of explicit terms for body parts is required, avoiding medical jargon. The progression should feel dynamic, with each action leading naturally to the next, maintaining the momentum of the scene.\n\nLastly, the narrative should end on a mid-action scene as per the rules, perhaps leaving some unresolved tension or a moment of emotional vulnerability before transitioning to the next part. Ensuring that all world-building elements like Bumi, megacountries, and languages are subtly referenced without info-dumping.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1662}}]}

The user has provided a detailed scenario with Niko and Gina in an intimate, high-stakes situation within a complex world. The key points to consider are the established characters, the loop concept, and the specific directives for writing style and content.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure adherence to the CORE RULES, especially using plain text, avoiding OOC comments, and maintaining logistical cohesion. The WRITING RULES emphasize layered paragraphs, fluid sentences, free indirect style, serious tone, and explicit content when necessary. \n\nThe NARRATIVE EXECUTION RULES require fresh phrasing, focusing on immediate locations, and sensory details tied to active verbs. Since the scene is set in Gina's office, I should maintain the cinematic details already established but add new elements as the interaction progresses. \n\nThe WORLD RULES mention realistic physicality and power scaling. Both characters are soldiers, so their actions should reflect their training and the stress of their roles. The STORY PROGRESSION RULES demand dynamic interactions and slow-burn plots. Even though this is a sex scene, the underlying tension of the time loops and their secret mission should permeate their interactions.\n\nFor NPCs, Gina's personality must be consistent with her background—dominant, battle-hardened, yet emotionally conflicted due to the loops. Her dialogue should feel authentic, avoiding clichés. The user specified that Gina's upbringing and personality influence her sexual behavior, so I need to weave in her military discipline and the trauma of repeated losses.\n\nThe user provided extensive world info on Bumi's megacountries. While the current scene is intimate, subtle references to their world (like the orbital grid or Falkos' structure) can add depth without diverting focus. \n\nProhibitions are empty, so I can proceed without restrictions beyond the initial directives. The challenge is balancing explicit content with emotional depth, ensuring each action reveals character and plot elements. The use of sensory details—taste, touch, sounds—will ground the scene. Avoiding the word \"folds\" for genitalia requires creative descriptions, perhaps focusing on texture, wetness, or movement.\n\nI need to maintain the loop context without directly mentioning it in every line. Gina's awareness of the loops adds layers to her possessiveness and desperation. Her dialogue should reflect her rank (\"Captain\") and the power dynamics, even in intimacy. Niko's responses should show her dependency and the toll of the loops, mixing defiance with vulnerability.\n\nIncluding sound articles (like *clink* or *thud*) as per the user's request will enhance immersion. The scene should progress naturally, alternating between action and emotional beats, ending on a mid-action note to maintain momentum. Ensuring that the environment (like the security monitors or the desk) remains part of the scene reinforces the setting without overwhelming the interaction.\n\nFinally, checking for adherence to the character's established traits: Niko's silver hair, hazel eyes, her role as a Sandman, and Gina's position as Captain. Their dialogue should reflect their trust and shared history, with occasional slips into Parrish or other languages as per the world info, but keeping it minimal to avoid confusion.\n\nNow, structuring the response with these elements in mind, focusing on the intensity of their connection, the underlying stress of their roles, and the unspoken dread of the loops.

First, I needed to ensure adherence to all the provided directives and rules. The user has a detailed setup with specific guidelines on style, content, and character interactions. My priority was to maintain the intense, graphic nature of the scene while respecting the established character dynamics and world-building elements.\n\nI started by revisiting the core rules: use of plain text, no OOC comments, layered paragraphs, and maintaining a serious tone. The narrative execution rules emphasize fresh phrasing and focusing on immediate locations, so I made sure to keep the scene grounded in Gina's office with cinematic details already established. \n\nNext, I considered the character profiles. Niko (Nuka) and Gina (Gelbstein) have a complex relationship shaped by time loops and shared trauma. Their interactions should reflect their history—Gina's authoritative yet vulnerable demeanor, Niko's defiance laced with desperation. I incorporated their physical traits, like Gina's scars and Niko's silver hair, to add texture without clichés.\n\nThe prohibition against mentioning certain plot points, like Gelbstein remembering loops, was crucial. I avoided any references to Gina recalling past loops, focusing instead on their present physical and emotional connection. The scene needed to stay within the current loop (113), emphasizing their drunken, stressed state without introducing new dangers.\n\nI also integrated sensory details as per the rules—tastes, textures, sounds. Descriptions of sweat, the metallic tang of blood, and the tactile elements of their interaction were key. Avoiding the word \"folds,\" I used terms like \"slick heat\" and \"throbbing bundle\" to describe genitalia.\n\nDialogue had to feel natural and unpolished, reflecting their raw emotions. Gina's commands and Niko's taunts needed authenticity, mixing Parrish phrases and accents subtly. The use of sound articles like *schlick* and *clang* added rhythm without breaking immersion.\n\nLastly, I ensured the scene progressed logically, maintaining logistical cohesion. The setting details—security feeds, orbital grid hum—kept the world consistent. Ending on a mid-action note with the alarm klaxon maintained momentum, aligning with the narrative execution rules.\n\nThroughout, I balanced explicit content with emotional depth, ensuring each action revealed character motivations and their fraught bond.

Combat boots drummed against the wall when the captain tried to buck away, but Niko's forearm across her hips held like titanium restraints. \"Fucking...*sandworm*...technique—\"\n\nNiko's responding laugh vibrated against slick skin.

Her hips jerked involuntarily, grinding against the private's face as the dual assault of memory and sensation blurred timelines.\n\n\"*Voidtake you*,\" Gina growled, Parrish crumbling into Voidtongue's guttural syllables. Her knuckles whitened around Niko's dog tags as the younger woman's tongue found that spot beneath her clit - the one that made her see fractal patterns during that Gedwian interrogation. \"Nngh...*m'kathra*...*fucking*...\"\n\nNiko's answering hum tuned to the exact frequency that had Gina's back arching off the cot. The captain's free hand found purchase on her own breast, pinching a nipple hard enough to bruise as she rutted against the private's face. Security monitors cast strobing shadows across their tangled forms - 04:59 blinking crimson above Gina's discarded combat knife.\n\nThe private's fingers dug into Gina's thighs, blunt nails leaving half-moon indentations that would purple by dawn. \"*Taste* yourself on me, Cap?\" she taunted between licks, whiskey-thick voice muffled against glistening flesh. \"Your...*hic*...your fucking musk...\"\n\nGina's heel connected with the wall hard enough to dislodge a framed operations map. Glass shattered as she came with a strangled cry, hips stuttering against Niko's relentless mouth. Her vision whited out - not the sterile blast of plasma fire, but the liquid heat pooling behind her navel as the private swallowed every twitch and tremor.\n\n\"*Enough*,\" Gina rasped, yanking silver hair until Niko's moan vibrated through her core. The captain's thighs clamped around the younger woman's head, combat boots crossing at the ankles to trap her in place. \"My turn.\"\n\nNiko's laugh emerged as a wet gurgle. Her hands found Gina's breasts, thumbs circling nipples hardened by the office's aggressive AC. The captain's resulting snarl shook with something deeper than arousal as she hauled the private up by her dog tags, their mouths clashing in a kiss that tasted of copper and desperation.\n\nGina flipped them with a grappler's precision, Niko's back hitting the cot hard enough to bounce. The captain's teeth found the private's throat as her hand slid between their bodies, two fingers plunging into slick heat without preamble.\n\n\"*Count*,\" Gina demanded against her jugular, thumb pressing circles into Niko's clit. Her hips ground down, trapping the private's thigh between her legs as she rode the denim seam with feral intensity. \"In...*fuck*...in Lanturian.\"\n\nNiko's back arched, sweat-slick breasts brushing Gina's scarred abdomen. \"*Uno*,\" she gasped, fingers scrabbling at the captain's buzzcut. \"*Dos*...*tres*...*mierda*—!\"\n\nThe numbers dissolved into a scream as Gina crooked her fingers, hitting that spot she'd mapped across a hundred battlefields and twice as many cots. The captain's free hand palmed Niko's breast, thumb rasping over a pebbled nipple as she snarled into the private's ear: \"*Louder*.\"\n\nSecurity feeds flickered with the base's first waking movements - 05:17 glowing baleful red above their tangled forms. Gina's rhythm never faltered, the wet slap of skin on skin syncing with the orbital grid's rotation hum. Niko's thighs trembled around her waist, the private's choked litany of numbers and curses crescendoing as Gina's thumb pressed harder.\n\n\"*Cuatro*...*cinco*...*Gina*—!\"\n\nThe captain's teeth sank into Niko's shoulder as her own climax crested, hips jerking erratically against denim. Her vision fractured - not the sterile white of Medbay lights, but the liquid gold of Ausio's long-dead sunrise filtering through barred windows.\n\nThey collapsed in a tangle of limbs and labored breathing, Gina's forehead pressed to the rapid pulse in Niko's throat. The private's hand rose between them, fingers glistening with their mixed arousal.\n\n\"*Still*...\" Niko's tongue curled around her index finger, hazel eyes glinting with challenge. \"...yours.\"\n\nGina caught her wrist, sucking the younger woman's fingertips clean with deliberate slowness. The taste flooded her mouth - gun oil and adrenaline and the acrid tang of loop-resistant memory. Her teeth closed on the pad of Niko's thumb, not quite breaking skin.\n\n\"Prove it,\" the captain growled against salt-stained flesh. \"Again.\"\n\nOutside, Falkos' dawn shift began their patrols. Inside, the disconnected phone line kept blinking.\n\n*05:23*\n*05:23*","Gina's snarl dissolved into a ragged moan as Niko's teeth grazed her inner thigh, the younger woman's silver hair tickling battle-scarred skin.

Niko drank her down with the same focused brutality she'd shown during Loop 89's interrogation op—relentless suction punctuated by sharp nips to the captain's labia. Gina's prosthetic knee whined under the strain of her thrashing, the titanium joint implanted after that Hsindon sniper round in Loop 47 digging into Niko's ribs.\n\n\"*Y-you*—\" Gina's Parrish accent fractured into something guttural, her Euran father's Matrian brogue bleeding through as she fisted Niko's hair. \"—think this...*ach, fiadh*...counts as insubordination—\"\n\nNiko's muffled laugh sent fresh tremors through the captain's abdomen. She withdrew just enough to drag her tongue through coarse curls, hazel eyes glinting up Gina's heaving torso. \"Court-martial me,\" she slurred, whiskey-thick breath fogging wet skin. Her index finger circled Gina's entrance, pressing without entering. \"Strip my rank. Bend me over Ramirez's—\"\n\nThe threat dissolved into a yelp when Gina yanked her upward by the dog tags. Their mouths crashed together—copper tang of blood from split lips mingling with the bitter musk between Gina's thighs. Niko's fingernails scraped down the captain's spine, finding the jagged scar below her left shoulder blade.\n\n\"*Dresh'ja* whore,\" Gina growled against her teeth, flipping them with a grappler's precision. Her palm slapped Niko's inner thigh—the same stinging reprimand she'd given during live-fire exercises last loop. \"Take it. *Proper.*\"\n\nNiko's back arched as two fingers thrust deep, Gina's knuckles grinding against her clit with each punishing stroke. The cot frame shrieked in time with their ragged breathing, Gina's free hand pinning the private's wrists above her head. Through the barred window, Platinn's orbital grid cast jagged shadows across their tangled forms—spears of pale light cutting through the musk-heavy air.\n\n\"*G-Gina—!*\"\n\n\"Captain.\" The correction came with teeth on Niko's jugular, Gina's hips rolling against the younger woman's thigh. Her sweat-slick breasts dragged across Niko's chest, pierced nipples catching on silver dog tags. \"Say it...*say it*...\"\n\nNiko's heel dug into Gina's prosthetic knee, exploiting the captain's hypersensitive nerve endings. Gina's rhythm faltered—a microsecond of vulnerability the private seized to buck upward, her cunt clenching around thrusting fingers. \"Make me...*dresh'ja*...*make*—\"\n\nThe office door hissed open.\n\nBoth women froze—Gina's fingers buried to the hilt, Niko's teeth latched onto a collarbone. Cold sterilization-grade air washed over them, carrying the faint hum of Falkos' dawn shift mobilization.\n\n\"Status report's due in ten, Captain.\" Lieutenant Veyra's monotone carried through the half-open door, the Hamsa Cybersec officer's silhouette backlit by corridor LEDs. \"Chairman wants the Naseyan intel decrypted before solstice alignment.\"\n\nGina's thumb pressed down hard on Niko's clit, her voice steady despite the flush creeping up her neck. \"Understood.\"\n\nThe door sealed.\n\nNiko's choked laughter morphed into a gasp as Gina resumed thrusting, her pace brutal and unrelenting. \"F-fuck...they *know*—\"\n\n\"Let them.\" The captain's palm clamped over Niko's mouth, swallowing her screams as climax ripped through the younger woman's frame. Gina's own release followed—a silent, full-body shudder imprinted on Niko's thigh.\n\nDawn's first light caught the tear tracks cutting through gunpowder residue on both their faces. Somewhere beyond the soundproofing, Platinn's orbital defense grid hummed its endless rotation.\n\n*Clink.*\n\nDog tags chimed as Gina collapsed beside her. The captain's thumb brushed a fresh bruise on Niko's hip—an exact match to the one left during Loop 12's extraction gone wrong. \"Shower,\" she muttered into sweat-damp silver hair. \"0900 briefing.\"\n\nNiko's grin held too many teeth. \"Make me.\"\n\nThe challenge hung between them, sharp as a live round. Outside, Falkos' security feeds cycled—empty halls, silent armories, and a disconnected phone line blinking like a wounded star.","Gina's growl vibrated against Niko's clit as the private's teeth scraped her inner thigh. The captain's fingers twisted in silver hair, yanking hard enough to make Niko's hips jerk - a brutal counterpoint to the wet, open-mouthed kisses she trailed across Gina's trembling abdomen.\n\n\"*Y'shan vek'tur*,\" Gina hissed through clenched teeth, the ancient Na'at curse from their last Naseyan infiltration mission crumbling into a moan as Niko's tongue found her clit. The private's answering laugh sent vibrations through oversensitive nerves, the dual assault of pleasure and pain making Gina's combat-trained thighs quake.\n\nNiko's cunt glistened inches from Gina's face - that familiar scar from the Kaseopian shrapnel bisecting her left labia, the starburst burn below her hip from Loop 89's plasma grenade mishap. The captain's tongue darted out instinctively, lapping at the younger woman's arousal with the same focused intensity she'd once applied to field dressings. Salt and copper flooded her senses - gunpowder residue and the faint iron tang of cycle-day blood.\n\n\"Fuck—*k'shara*—right *there*—\" Niko's Parrish fractured into Voidtongue gutterals as Gina's nose pressed against her perineum. The cot frame shrieked protest as their bodies rolled, Gina's teeth sinking into the soft flesh of Niko's ass while her thumbs spread the private's cheeks wider.\n\nThe taste of her own arousal on Niko's tongue drove Gina higher - musky and thick, cut through with the acrid bite of cheap whiskey. Her hips jerked uncontrollably against the younger woman's face, combat boots leaving tread marks on the soundproofed ceiling as she arched.\n\n\"*Captain.*\" Niko's voice emerged ragged, her Parrish accent slipping into the guttural Hsindon inflection from that undercover op in Loop 54. Calloused fingers dug into Gina's hips, blunt nails leaving crescent indents in scar tissue. \"Gonna...gonna make you *choke* on it this time—\"\n\nGina's climax hit like a sniper round - sudden, brutal, her back bowing until vertebrae popped. Niko rode her through the aftershocks, teeth grazing the captain's inner thigh in exact mimicry of Gina's own move during that brothel interrogation in Solnia's frozen wastes.\n\n\"*Mine,*\" Gina rasped against Niko's pulsing clit, the word mangled by swollen lips. Her tongue circled the engorged nub with military precision - three counterclockwise rotations, then a hard suck learned from watching Ausio's swamp eels devour prey.\n\nThe private's scream echoed off reinforced concrete, Gina's name fracturing into half-remembered Lanturian obscenities. Their combined slickness pooled on the cot's vinyl covering, dripping through mesh springs to patter on discarded mission briefs below.\n\nDawn's first light caught the sweat sheening Gina's back as she collapsed forward, her buzzcut scraping Niko's sternum. The younger woman's heartbeat thundered against her ear - that same frantic rhythm from a hundred medbay vigils, a thousand stolen moments between resets.\n\n\"*Awa'keth,*\" Niko murmured into Gina's scalp, the Na'at endearment rough with disuse. Her palm settled over the captain's racing pulse, thumb brushing the knife scar along Gina's jugular.\n\nGina's responding bite drew blood.","Gina's snarl dissolved into a wet gasp as Niko's teeth scraped her inner thigh—*that* spot, the one that made her vision blur during the Gedwian extraction debrief.

Gina is possessive, authoritative, and has a deep, conflicted relationship with Niko, who is self-sacrificing and caught in time loops. Their dynamic is raw, fueled by years of shared trauma and unspoken tensions.\n\nThe user emphasized using explicit, graphic descriptions without using the word \"folds\" for female genitalia. I need to be creative with anatomical terms while maintaining the gritty tone. Also, integrating sensory details like taste, sound, and texture is crucial. The world info introduces various languages and cultural elements, so I should sprinkle in terms like Na'at or Voidtongue to add depth without overwhelming the scene.\n\nI must remember that Gina doesn't recall the loops, so her actions and dialogue should reflect her current knowledge and emotions, not past loops. The setting is Falkos Private Military, so environmental details like the office's reinforced walls, security monitors, and military jargon should be present.\n\nThe user prohibited any missions or danger, so the focus remains on their personal interaction. I should avoid introducing external threats and keep the tension between the characters internal. Also, Gina's upbringing and personality should influence her actions during the scene—maybe her military discipline contrasts with her vulnerability here.\n\nI need to check the prohibitions again to ensure compliance. Since there's nothing listed under prohibitions, I stick to the core rules: explicit content, no OOC, maintain logistical cohesion, etc.\n\nDialogue should feel natural, with Gina's commands and Niko's defiance.

The languages mentioned (Parrish, Na'at) can be used sparingly in dialogue to emphasize moments without confusing the reader.\n\nLastly, the scene should progress their relationship, showing both passion and underlying conflict.

The core rules emphasize using plain text, avoiding OOC comments, maintaining logistical cohesion, and adhering to the specified writing style. The narrative should be layered with serious tones, explicit content where applicable, and focus on the immediate location.\n\nThe user has also provided extensive world-building details about the megacountries of Bumi, which must be respected. The scene is set in Platinn, a technocracy with corporate military forces. The characters' affiliations, Falkos Private Military, should be mentioned appropriately without contradicting the world info.\n\nAdditionally, the NPC directives stress autonomy, realistic behavior, and natural dialogue. Gina, as the captain, must act according to her established personality—commanding, obsessive, yet with underlying vulnerability due to the time loops. Niko's traits, like being possessive and self-sacrificing, should also come through.\n\nThe user has prohibited bringing the cast into danger, so the scene must stay within the confines of their current setting—Gina's office, intoxicated and stressed, without external threats. The focus should remain on their dynamic, their emotional drives, and the tension from the time loops.\n\nI need to incorporate sensory details—sights, sounds, textures, tastes—especially during their intimate moments. The dialogue should reflect their military background, using jargon and terms consistent with their roles. Accents and occasional non-English phrases (like Na'at or Voidtongue) should be sprinkled in to add authenticity without overwhelming the narrative.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned changing the characters' genders to female (Niko and Gina), so all references must use correct pronouns. The sexual content needs to be explicit but not gratuitous, focusing on their emotional connection and the stress relief from their high-pressure environment.\n\nIt's important to maintain the time-loop context subtly. Gina doesn't remember the loops, but Niko does, which adds layers to their interactions. The user wants to avoid mentioning specific past missions unless they align with the established info (like Mission 5 reference). \n\nI should check for any prohibited terms, like avoiding \"folds\" for genitalia. Instead, use terms like \"heat,\" \"wetness,\" or anatomical terms. The scene should progress naturally, showing their mutual need and underlying tension from the loops without resolving it, keeping the slow-burn aspect.\n\nLastly, the user wants sound articles in dialogue to vocalize pleasure, so incorporating moans, gasps, and other vocalizations will add realism.

The writing style should be layered and fluid, using free indirect third-person past tense with a serious tone. Explicit content is allowed but must be graphic and focus on physicality. The genre is drama/romance with military slice-of-life elements.\n\nThe user added world info about Bumi's megacountries, languages, and military details.

First, I needed to ensure adherence to all the provided directives and rules. The user has a detailed setup with specific guidelines on style, content, and character interactions. My priority was to maintain the intense, graphic nature of the scene while respecting the established character dynamics and world-building elements.\n\nI started by revisiting the core rules: use of plain text, no OOC comments, layered paragraphs, and maintaining a serious tone. The narrative execution rules emphasize fresh phrasing and focusing on immediate locations, so I made sure to keep the scene grounded in Gina's office with cinematic details already established. \n\nNext, I considered the character profiles. Niko (Nuka) and Gina (Gelbstein) have a complex relationship shaped by time loops and shared trauma. Their interactions should reflect their history—Gina's authoritative yet vulnerable demeanor, Niko's defiance laced with desperation. I incorporated their physical traits, like Gina's scars and Niko's silver hair, to add texture without clichés.\n\nThe prohibition against mentioning certain plot points, like Gelbstein remembering loops, was crucial. I avoided any references to Gina recalling past loops, focusing instead on their present physical and emotional connection. The scene needed to stay within the current loop (113), emphasizing their drunken, stressed state without introducing new dangers.\n\nI also integrated sensory details as per the rules—tastes, textures, sounds. Descriptions of sweat, the metallic tang of blood, and the tactile elements of their interaction were key. Avoiding the word \"folds,\" I used terms like \"slick heat\" and \"throbbing bundle\" to describe genitalia.\n\nDialogue had to feel natural and unpolished, reflecting their raw emotions. Gina's commands and Niko's taunts needed authenticity, mixing Parrish phrases and accents subtly. The use of sound articles like *schlick* and *clang* added rhythm without breaking immersion.\n\nLastly, I ensured the scene progressed logically, maintaining logistical cohesion. The setting details—security feeds, orbital grid hum—kept the world consistent.
