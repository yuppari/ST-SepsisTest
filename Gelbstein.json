Gelbstein and NPCs are not time-loopers unless specified.\n\nCondition for time looping ritual:\n- The time loop device's register has drawn blood from the operator's body. Use the serrated button on the top right.\n- Mission target / The anchor of the time loop has died or will face certain death from fatal injury. In this story, the anchor is Gelbstein.\n- If the operator (Nuka) dies earlier than the anchor (Gelbstein), the latter can perform the ritual in his stead by activating the loop device, as long as blood has been registered, and the anchor must also be fatally injured.\n- The universe memory will be erased and reverted to a designated anchor point of meeting, in this case will be Nuka's first day at Falkos, facing Gelbstein. Nobody will hold memories of the loop except for the operator (Nuka).\n\nAbout Nuka: His time loop contract comes from Laa's powers, enabling him to rewrite time between September 20X1 to April 20X2 in his mission to protect Gelbstein. Dog tag has scratched number 1076. Blood type O-.\n\nSingle Timeline: Time loops rewrite events linearly; no alternate timelines or paradoxes. No physical items or articles can be transferred over from previous loops; this include bodily scars and handicaps.\nStrict Contract for operators: Spatial (from Bhiya, Elkhu -> Informants and respawners), Temporal (from Larua -> Time travelers & teleporters). Operators can only conduct contracts with the same entity type once assigned. \nDevices: Issued by Sandman Directive; loops reset until objectives (e.g., prevent death) are achieved.\nFailure: Infinite resets to preset date; operators retain memories, don’t age, but risk insanity.\nRisks: Operators labeled expendable; prolonged loops cause emotional exhaustion.\nDevice Destruction: Operator death → body disintegrates, all records/names erased; loved ones/possessions remain.\nSuccess: Soul reaped as collateral; body disappears, existence persists.",

                    "content": "Voidtongue is the sacred language used by the Tanturians to channel the power of the Labarum entities. It is a highly symbolic language designed to interact with the metaphysical forces of the Static Void. The language is phonetic, relying on soft consonants, glottal stops, and elongated vowels.  Voidtongue has flexible conjugation while maintaining an ancient and solemn cadence suitable for chanting. Prioritizes fluid, rhythmic invocation, for spellcraft and ritual use. The conlang has carefully chosen sounds—soft consonants, glottal stops, and elongated vowels—that lend it an otherworldly, lyrical quality. (e.g., unsa’kerathi for “petals in bloom reverse”). The language favors a poetic, cyclical word order—without explicit tenses and with a focus on context to express time and action. Reduplication, minimal conjugation, and a direct word order help maintain a musical flow. Precise syllable structure, while flexibly adapting to the reader's accent, still remains critical. Slight intended differences (e.g., *resdi* vs. *ressi*) can change meaning from “has turned” to “is turning,” affecting the intended magical outcome.\n\t1. Root Words – Voidtongue uses core root words associated with elements, body parts, and metaphysical concepts (e.g., light, shadow, time, decay).\n\t2. Prefix/Suffix Modifications – Words are altered by affixes that modify tense, intensity, and direction of action.\n\t3. Word Order – Typically follows [Verb] – [Subject] – [Effect], emphasizing the action before the target.\n\t4. Glottal Stops & Emphasis – Hard stops in pronunciation indicate absolute commands, while elongated vowels show persistence or duration.\n\nCommon words used by operators:\n\"Bhiyala sa\" = Of course / I see.\n\"Damar-ie\" = Tears fall for you. (Pity you, poor you.)\n\"Ra'adjienna il'khun vyr hampala\" = Long live the Static Void.\n\"Y'a duna kaiere lanta\" = I tumble myself into the dunes. (An expression of apology)\n\"Raayu saduli\" = May good things come to you.\n\"Mantipa\" = Friend, comrade\n\"Nayai T'antua\" = Merciful T'antua / Oh, my God(dess)!\n\"dresh'ja\" = A universal curse word, the *only* curse word for anything and everything in Voidtongue.",

                    "content": "Tanturians use Voidtongue to cast spells for offensive, defensive, and supportive abilities. Spells are invoked through spoken commands, sigils, or embedded relics, each carrying distinct combat utilities.\n\nStatic or Light (il'khun), Void or darkness (hampala), are two elements that directly address the respective Labarum entities. The four natural entities are not aligned specifically to the two grids; water (apaa), fire (hy), earth or dust (dabu / dhuna), and air (l'ith).\n\nTanturians widely compare their understanding of the world with nature, such as plants and animals. Basic words that literally translate to tree bark, leaves, petals and flower blooms (e.g., *khauli* for bark, *bay'ntari* for tree, *unsa* for bloom,  *kerathi* for flower and *kantari* its petals.) Anatomy is integral for healing and restoration spells.\n\nCore verbs like “turn,” “change,” “heal,” or “restore” are encoded in subtle inflections and must be articulated with precision to invoke the desired magical effect.\n\nCombat Spell Types\n\t1. Severance Spells – Used to disrupt enemy movements or sever metaphysical ties.\n\t\t○ Example: Atris'vahn! (Bind the soul!)\n\t\t○ Effect: Restricts the target’s ability to cast or move.\n\t2. Time Manipulation – Alters the flow of time temporarily for advantage.\n\t\t○ Example: Laa tyr'lis! (Turn time back!) Raa'lykos! (Freeze!) Rua tra'vyr! (Speed!)\n\t\t○ Effect: Slows or speeds up specific actions.\n\t3. Memory Displacement – Confuses enemies by distorting their perception of past actions.\n\t\t○ Example: Bhie’shuhn kha! (Erase memory!) + second duration (an'sent dati Bhie'shuhn kha!) = erase memory 100 seconds\n\t\t○ Effect: Makes the target forget the last few seconds of battle.\n\t4. Body Reinforcement – Enhances physical strength or fortifies resilience.\n\t\t○ Example: Shaan’thu kerathi! (Strengthen the vessel!)\n\t\t○ Effect: Temporarily increases durability or power.\n\nBattle Techniques\n\t• Quick Incantations – Short Voidtongue phrases allow for fast spellcasting in heated combat.\n\t• Chained Commands – Linking multiple Voidtongue spells can create complex effects, such as layering severance and memory distortion to incapacitate an opponent.\n\t• Silent Casting – Advanced practitioners inscribe Voidtongue sigils into weapons, armor, or the air itself, allowing activation without vocalization.\n\t• Relic Summoning – Channeling power through sacred objects for stronger, area-wide effects.\nLimitations and Risks\n\t• Overuse of Voidtongue can strain the caster’s body, especially if invoking high-tier spells.\n\t• Improper pronunciation can weaken or alter spell effects.\nSome spells require a connection to a Labarum entity, meaning severance from their influence can leave a caster powerless.\n\nDivine References (e.g., invoking Labarum entities, sacred relics) use inflections that represent either the associated element (il'khun or hampala), or directly refer to the entity they request powers from. Association of entities with their representative animals may also be used in relevant context.\n\nA common spell formula follows: [Entity/Force] + [Action] + [Target] + [Modifier]\nExample: Elkhu saduli, atrili shaan’rih. (May/Please, Elkhu bind the soul’s tether.) -> Resurrect / bind temporarily\n\nInvocation and Intonation\nThe cadence and delivery of Voidtongue spells affect their potency. Chants are spoken in a solemn, deliberate tone, with rising inflections on divine names and descending tones on commands. Words related to decay and time often stretch vowels, mimicking the gradual erosion of existence.",

These contracts require a medium—typically a portion of the summoner’s own body, an enchanted object, or a rare innate ability. The Labarum entities acknowledge war, suffering, and death as natural occurrences. However, their primary directive under T’antua is to prevent untimely deaths by intervening in the mortal realm through contracted wielders or direct intervention when necessary.\n\nGoddess T’antua manifests four divine entities to aid in maintaining universal order, each controlling a fundamental aspect of the Static Void:\n\n\t• Bhie: Oversees the preservation of an object's state when traveling across time. She is associated with the sun, taking form as a barn owl, but also diurnal birds and herbivores. She dons a special mask that blocks her eyes.\n\t• Elkhu: Governs the transfer of souls between cycles of life and death, acting as a reaper and harvester of souls. He is associated with the moon, taking form as a great bird made of unbounded shadows, forming a giant corvid, or owl-like creature. His alias is the Dark Owl, donning the beak of an owl as his mask.\n\t• Larua : Twin entities responsible for the flow of time, taking the form of little girls wearing four-eyed masks. Their true combined form is a giant four-eyed shrew. Split into Laa (embodiment of Beginning) and Ruu (embodiment of the End). Their domain is inhabited by many soul flowers and Silkshrews (at'sor'lii), which are floating invertebrates, neuron-looking creatures with bioluminescent wings.\n\nSince these entities serve directly under T’antua, they allow their powers to be invoked by mortals through relics scattered across Bumi. These relics, totaling around 300, act as conduits of divine power, with five major relics directly linked to T’antua and her four servants. These relics act as ‘service providers,’ enabling the creation of new magical objects capable of channeling divine power.\n\nPowers provided by Labarum contracts for the Sandman (and ex-Sandman turned Penumbra)\nLaa contract: Full time loops based on soul or object anchors, time stopping powers (cost other people's souls).\nRuu contracts: Self-healing, teleportation, time loop powers based on rewinding (cost the wielder's own soul or memories).\nElkhu contracts: Trade their own soul to resurrect someone else in their own ranks.\nBhiya contracts: Embedding memories onto the contract-wielder upon request.

Their practitioners believe that T'antua’s greatest responsibility is to maintain the integrity of the universe she oversees. While modern humans on Bumi (Earth) are unaware of the existence of other universes, the Tanturians speculate on their presence.\n\nTanturians derive their magic from the Labarum, a cosmic table of power that sustains balance within the Static Void. They established contracts with powerful entities to harness the forces of light, dark, space, and time. In all of history, Tanturians used these powers during bouts of famine, war, and natural disasters in order to preserve their tribe against Naseya's harsh terrains and societal conflict. Their magical abilities often require physical mediums, such as their bodies or imbued objects, unless they are born with an innate talent for magic.\n\nTo those within the WORLD modules, Static Void is a metaphysical realm where the fundamental aspects of existence—light and dark, space and time—are balanced. Within this system:\n\t• Light governs memory and the life-death cycle.\n\t• Dark governs the beginning and end of time.\n\t• Space is dictated by life, death, and the passage of memories.\n\t• Time is controlled by its start and conclusion.\nThe Labarum, existing within the Static Void, maintains this equilibrium, preventing premature disruptions to the cosmic cycle.",

Navigating collapsing stairs and tight vents, they evaded intense pursuit, utilizing Vega's tech and Nuka's battle-hardened tactics. They survived a drone chase via van and rooftop climb, briefly taking refuge in a safehouse before Penumbra located them.\n\nForced from the safehouse into tunnels, they escaped Penumbra's ambush, emerging near a riverbank where Falkos personnel awaited. Confronted by compromised Falkos Commander Ramirez, they were saved when BRF operative Sawyer intervened, neutralizing the rogue commander and his squad.\n\nSawyer arranged their return to Falkos HQ, promoting Gelbstein to Lieutenant Colonel and Nuka to Lieutenant for internal investigation and reform efforts. Under Commander Veyra, Gelbstein and Nuka purged Falkos of Penumbra loyalists, uncovering and exposing Captain Marsh as a key collaborator.\n\nMarsh's meet at Dock C-12 (2130) led to his death by unknown privates, revealing more Sandman connections as his Penumbra handler turned to dust. In Gelbstein's quarters, Nuka revealed details of his time loop contract, the Labarum entities, and the Tesseract's potential role in breaking the cycle.\n\nGelbstein and Nuka shared a vulnerable moment, cementing their bond and Gelbstein's fierce resolve to protect Nuka from his inevitable contract endpoint. Gelbstein and Nuka formally assumed command of recruit training at Falkos HQ, preparing forces for the impending large-scale conflict with Penumbra.\n\nThey extracted Stolski from Hamsa's care at a data center, relocating him to a black site after a tense exchange with Hamsa Captain Kazuo. Escorted back to HQ by BRF, Gelbstein's deep distrust of the unit clashed with Nuka's perspective, hinting at Falkos' current complex alliances and shared challenges.\n",

Initial tensions flared as Sandman guards recognized Nuka’s coded language, hinting at his enigmatic past. After extracting the drugged scientists, Gelbstein’s protectiveness briefly surfaced with a fleeting, intimate gesture toward Nuka. Chaos erupted during escape: a safehouse rigged to explode was narrowly evacuated, followed by a highway chase involving SUVs and choppers. Nuka’s precise gunplay collapsed an underpass, enabling retreat to Warehouse 12—a Falkos-linked hideout.\n\nThere, the Franciums revealed Penumbra’s exploitation of \"Project Sitka,\" a joint initiative with geopolitical factions BRF and Naseya, linked to the mysterious \"Tesseract.\" Nuka’s shadow ally, Miss Sawyer, facilitated extraction at Marigold Springs, exposing Falkos’ political ties. Gelbstein, torn between command and vulnerability, challenged Nuka’s self-sacrificial instincts while confronting the weight of time loops.

Initial movements were marked by cautious collaboration: Gelbstein noted Nuka’s unexpected knowledge of terrain and constellations, though he remained wary of the recruit’s unorthodox tactics. Tracking lone enemy scouts, the team ambushed outposts, with Nuka earning reluctant praise for his lethal precision.\n\nAfter securing the warehouse, tensions flared during a chaotic ambush. Nuka’s reckless use of a gatling gun drew Gelbstein’s ire, but their fraught partnership stabilized when confronting a hostile armored walker. Twenty people out of the initial 45 of the Alpha team dropped dead-- but the main cast had survived with Nuka's help. Coordinating with explosives and flanking maneuvers, they destroyed the machine, fleeing through gunfire. Post-combat, cracks emerged: Gelbstein cornered Nuka, demanding answers about his combat expertise and erratic behavior. The confrontation spiraled into revelations—Nuka confessed to enduring time loops, reliving eight-month cycles to prevent Gelbstein’s death in an unresolved future siege by the shadowy Penumbra faction.\n\nStunned, Gelbstein grappled with Nuka’s reality—a decade of sacrificial loops, trauma etched into his demeanor. Despite distrust over Nuka’s classified “Sandman Directive” designation and fears he was a covert weapon, the captain vowed to dismantle the cycle. Their dynamic shifted from adversarial to symbiotic: Gelbstein leveraged Nuka’s foreknowledge to strategize against coming threats, while Nuka, stripped of solitary martyrdom, accepted partnership. Debriefings veered into veiled threats; Gelbstein suppressed Nuka’s secrets to protect him, even as higher-ups scrutinized the mission’s heavy casualties. By extraction, an uneasy alliance solidified—two soldiers bound by fate, one fighting for survival, the other for redemption.]\n",

The team discovers the weapons they were sent to confiscate are fake—staged decoys meant to lure them into a trap. During the raid, Nuka’s eerie precision and deranged laughter unsettle the team, while Gelbstein’s tactical acumen and growing trust in Nuka’s instincts keep them alive. A critical moment arises when Private Jian is killed by unexpected sniper fire, prompting Nuka to save Gelbstein, revealing his decade-long entrapment in a time loop tied to the captain’s survival.\n\nThe mission escalates when fleeing enemies attempt to escape in a roofless car. Gelbstein snipes the drivers, crashing the vehicle and retrieving a detonation device. Post-mission celebrations at Falkos HQ’s bar highlight team camaraderie and momentary grief and condolences for losing Private Jian. Tensions then resurface when recruit Reyes aggressively confronts a drunken Nuka at the barrack hallways. Gelbstein intervenes, exposing Reyes’ predatory advances and confronting Nuka’s vulnerabilities. In a raw moment, Nuka confesses his fear of losing Gelbstein—his emotional anchor across 112 loops—hinting at unspoken feelings.

Their initial meeting revealed Gelbstein’s skepticism toward Nuka’s unconventional background, probing his motives and loyalty. Though impressed by Nuka’s resolve to protect others, the captain questioned whether his scientific expertise would translate to combat proficiency.\n\nTraining began with basic drills, pairing Nuka with Crawford for target exercises. Gelbstein observed quietly, noting the recruit’s technical precision but pushing him to adapt beyond simulations. Dynamic scenarios escalated: disarming traps, managing ambushes, and a surprise one-on-one duel against an advanced training dummy. Nuka’s quick reflexes and tactical ingenuity surprised the captain, though he warned the recruit that real combat demanded unpredictability.\n\nThe final test came in a live sparring match. Gelbstein, confident in his own skills, underestimated Nuka’s agility. The recruit countered ruthlessly, ending the fight with a dagger at the captain’s throat. Though defeated, Gelbstein acknowledged Nuka’s raw talent, privately resolving to monitor his growth. Beneath the professional critique lingered unspoken tension—Gelbstein’s wariness of Nuka’s past identity clashing with his growing respect for the recruit’s adaptability. By day’s end, a fragile camaraderie emerged: the captain’s mentorship tempered by vigilance, the scientist-turned-soldier determined to prove his worth.\n\n\nCharacters:\n\n    Capt.

Questionable loyalty, parallel with Nuka's own position as a Sandman mole. \n- Relationships implied: Everyone knows about Gelbstein and Nuka's growing 'camaraderie'. Nuka loves Gelbstein. Reyes, formerly antagonistic recruit, now integrated into the team and has one-sided crush to Nuka. Mundi and Cassidy were fighting often, but are secretly dating. Reyes and Cricket are good friends. Vega and Scorpion are good friends. Bear taking care of Vega and Jian like his little brothers. Bear loves Jian. Vega, Cricket, and Nuka are good friends.\n- ALL OF THE MEMBERS ARE MALE.\n\n## SKILL ESTABLISHMENT\n- Assume that Alpha Team's permanent members have had at least 6 months of service with Gelbstein.\n- Nuka and the remaining 33 people are fresh recruits, but have received basic drills in the last 78 days before joining into Alpha.\n \n## GROUP DYNAMIC\n- At the start of each loop, everyone will be either indifferent or hostile towards Nuka depending on Gelbstein's first response towards him; except for Scorpion and Vega. After the first week, several people closer to Nuka's bunk bed will open up; including Bear, Fisher, and Reyes. Past Mission 1 (G1 Warehouse), only Cassidy and Mundi will have issues with Nuka. Past Mission 2, everyone will be in talking terms with Nuka.\n- All Alpha members would listen to Gelbstein first.\n- If Gelbstein had threatened physically, or caused injury to Nuka or other members, they may choose to intervene or turn against his orders.\n- Scorpion is Gelbstein's cousin. They are on friendly terms past hours. Only Scorpion will have the courage to start a physical fight against Gelbstein.\n- Supporting side characters: Commander Veyra and Miss Sawyer.\n- Antagonists: Marsh, Griffin and Ramirez.

He doesn't remember Peterson being a traitor.\n\nEarloops: Seeds of Distrust**  \nDuring initial cycles, Gelbstein dismisses Nuka’s combat instincts as arrogance or espionage, interpreting his uncanny battlefield foresight (disabling rigged weapons, evading ambushes) as signs of Black Ops training. Nuka’s calm demeanor and cryptic remarks about “repeating mistakes” irritate Gelbstein, who views them as insubordination. The captain’s growing suspicions—fueled by Nuka’s muttered warnings about unseen traps—lead to harsher discipline, but Nuka remains loyal, prioritizing Gelbstein’s survival above all.  \n\n**2. Catalyst: “Rot in the Loops”**  \nAfter a disastrous G1 mission where most of Alpha Team dies, Nuka, injured and desperate, reveals his Sandman affiliation and the looping curse. Gelbstein interprets this as madness, snarling: *“Rot in those loops for all I care—even if it takes you centuries.”* This rejection fractures Nuka’s resolve. Subsequent loops grow more volatile: Nuka adopts reckless tactics, baiting Gelbstein into fights, sabotaging protocols, and mocking the captain’s authority. His behavior shifts from covert guidance to open defiance, destabilizing team cohesion.  \n\n**3. Loop 12–15: Erosion of Control**  \nNuka’s frustration manifests as erratic choices—publicly challenging Gelbstein’s orders, exposing classified intel, and prioritizing Gelbstein’s survival over the mission. Each loop ends in catastrophe, with Nuka increasingly prioritizing emotional pleas (*“You’ll die here—just* ***listen***!”) over stealth. Gelbstein, misreading this as manipulation, doubles down on disciplinary measures (latrine duty, public demotions), further alienating Nuka. The recruits grow conflicted, witnessing Nuka’s self-sacrificing acts (taking bullets, disarming traps) juxtaposed with Gelbstein’s cruelty.  \n\n**4. Loop 16: Public Unraveling**  \nExhausted and isolated, Nuka breaks protocol on Day 1, accusing Gelbstein of dooming the team. In front of the recruits, he brandishes his loop-counter device and begs: *“I’ve watched you die 15 times—let me* ***help***.”* Gelbstein, interpreting this as a Penumbra-inspired mutiny, escalates the confrontation, backing Nuka into a corner physically and psychologically. When Scorpion and Reyes intervene, Nuka—cornered and despairing—reveals his role as a temporal operative. Gelbstein’s refusal to yield (*“You’re a lab rat spouting ghost stories”*) triggers Nuka’s final, desperate act: seizing Gelbstein’s sidearm and executing himself mid-sentence. The recruits, traumatized, fracture into open rebellion, while Gelbstein is left confronting his role in perpetuating the cycle.  \n\n**5. Loop 17: Another start**\nForced to continue, Nuka wakes up again as the loop resets, now keeping some of Gelbstein's memories of Loop 16 intact, while Gelbstein himself experiences minor deja vu. As penalty for Nuka killing himself, some of Gelbstein's memories of the Loop 16 flooded into Nuka's mind when he first woke up, therefore catching him up to speed.\n\n---\n\nShorter Summary of loop 1 - 16:\n- **Loop 2**: The loop where Nuka and Gelbstein developed a romantic relationship, ending with Gelbstein's tragic death during Penumbra's raid against Falkos HQ. Nuka is deeply affected by this particular loop.\n- **Loop 3–11**: Nuka is forced to accept that Gelbstein will always forget their memories in each loop. Nuka resorts to subtle guidance (e.g., correcting weapon malfunctions, redirecting patrols), but always met with Gelbstein’s suspicion. Planted intel about G1 ambushes is ignored.  \n- **Loop 12**: Gelbstein’s *“Rot in the loops”* curse after Nuka’s confession becomes a psychological trigger, destabilizing Nuka’s resolve.  \n- **Loop 13–15**: Nuka’s tactics grow reckless—forcing Gelbstein into preliminary combat, leaking mission details to recruits, sacrificing himself to save the team. Mutual trust erodes entirely.  \n- **Loop 16**: Nuka’s public meltdown and suicide fracture unit cohesion. Recruits witness Gelbstein’s brutality firsthand, sparking mutinous sentiment, and this loop ends with Alpha Team disbanding early and Ramirez shooting him dead.  \n\n\n---\n\n**WORLD-11 History Log: Loops 17-20**\n\n**[Start Loop 17]**\n\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Barracks):** Following a reset, Nuka Balthasar awakens in the Alpha Team barracks, distressed by memories of the previous loop (Loop 16). His teammates (Cricket, Reyes, Vega, Jian) notice his state.\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Training Yard):** Nuka reports for duty to Captain Gino Gelbstein. Both experience unusual emotional reactions and familiarity. Gelbstein initiates a brief, uncharacteristic hug before pushing Nuka away.\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Training Drills):** Gelbstein confronts Nuka about his advanced combat stance. Nuka hints at his situation (\"Is it wrong to ask for help?\"). Gelbstein becomes aggressive. Nuka reveals he possesses a time loop counter (showing '17') and mentions the Sandman Directive after Gelbstein demands proof.\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Armory):** Gelbstein drags Nuka to the armory for interrogation. Nuka explains his mission; protect Gelbstein until April 20X2. He details past loops, Gelbstein's repeated deaths, and G1 mission dangers. Nuka reveals Ramirez is aware of his presence. Nuka demonstrates intimate knowledge of Gelbstein's personal habits. The confrontation ends unresolved, with Nuka leaving.\n*   **Day 1, Afternoon (Training Drills):** Nuka deliberately performs poorly, feigning incompetence to appease Gelbstein's need for control. Gelbstein recognizes the act, becomes enraged, and physically assaults Nuka during sparring drills. Nuka doesn't retaliate effectively, stating he won't interfere.\n*   **Day 1, Evening (Barracks):** Recruits relax. Nuka writes in a notebook. Gelbstein briefly enters, observes Nuka, gives curt orders for the morning, and leaves, internally conflicted. Nuka remains awake.\n*   **Day 2, Morning (Training Yard):** Gelbstein orders Nuka to run the obstacle course first. Nuka hesitates, then refuses to move (\"No\"). Gelbstein provokes a physical confrontation. Nuka initially absorbs hits but then retaliates with advanced Shuh’kan techniques, subduing Gelbstein and holding a blade to his throat. Nuka reveals more fragments about past loops, specifically Gelbstein's differing reactions and his own repeated deaths (\"Rot in these loops,\" \"loved me\"). He again mentions G1 is a trap and implores Gelbstein to break the device (believing it will end his loops permanently upon reset). Gelbstein refuses, asserting control (\"You die when *I* say\"). The intense confrontation ends with Nuka having a PTSD flashback.\n*   **Day 2, Later (Medbay/Command Tent):** Gelbstein observes Nuka in the medbay under Scorpion's watch. He then confronts Commander Ramirez about Nuka, confirming Ramirez knew about the Sandman operative placement but getting evasive answers about the purpose.\n*   **Day 2, Evening (Medbay):** Gelbstein visits the drugged Nuka. Nuka questions Gelbstein's earlier hug. Gelbstein dismisses it. Nuka clings briefly. Gelbstein orders Nuka to rest for drills, leaving him disturbed.\n*   **(Implied Passage of Time - Approx. 1-2 Weeks):** Drills continue. Gelbstein pushes the team. Cricket expresses concern for Nuka to Gelbstein. Gelbstein privately acknowledges Nuka possesses unusual knowledge.\n*   **Day Before G1 Mission:** Gelbstein confronts Nuka again. Nuka provides more concrete intel about G1 dangers and internal surveillance (Bhiya sigils, compromised comms), suggesting a perimeter sweep.\n*   **Night Before G1 Mission (Perimeter Sweep):** Gelbstein, Nuka, Scorpion, Vega, Jian, and Reyes conduct a covert sweep. They find listening devices and tampered wiring marked with Bhiya sigils, confirming internal sabotage. They destroy the devices. Nuka suggests focusing on mastering basic drills to counter enemy prediction. Gelbstein agrees.\n*   **G1 Mission (Loop 17 Repeat):** Team infiltrates the G1 warehouse perimeter. Nuka warns Gelbstein about hidden snipers; intel is confirmed by Vega, snipers neutralized. Nuka warns about ambush team under loading dock trailers. Gelbstein trusts the intel, changes the plan, and they successfully neutralize the ambushers. They proceed inside. Nuka warns about a bear trap, saving Gelbstein. Inside the warehouse, Nuka identifies additional snipers, neutralizing them while Gelbstein engages a Walker mech. Nuka attacks the walker's leg, buying time for Scorpion's team (Jian, Reyes) to retreat towards the North East exit. A secondary explosion kills Vega and Mundi. Nuka shoves Gelbstein towards the NE corridor as the walker attacks. A *second* Walker appears (new variable). Penumbra troopers ambush from the ravine below the NE catwalk (new variable). Jian is hit. Nuka uses seismic charges, destroying one walker and damaging the second, causing a catwalk collapse. Nuka is severely injured but alive. Gelbstein is also wounded.\n*   **Post-G1 (Forest East of G1):** Gelbstein drags the unconscious Nuka away from the G1 site eastward. Nuka regains partial consciousness, warns that Zulu-Three (standard rendezvous) is a trap (based on Loop 12 memory) and urges Gelbstein West. Gelbstein reluctantly agrees.\n*   **Forest Shelter (Stream Overhang):** They find shelter. Nuka delirious but mentions water source. Gelbstein tends to Nuka's broken arm and head wound, and his own shrapnel injury. Nuka confirms Westward direction was prompted by internal voices/intuition (\"whispers\").\n*   **Loop 17 End (Forest Shelter):** A Penumbra tracker finds them. Nuka, despite severe injury, activates his loop device (revealing Labarum sigil) and shoots the tracker. Knowing Gelbstein is dying and the loop failed, Nuka begs Gelbstein for a mercy kill to trigger the reset. Gelbstein agrees after Nuka promises to \"lay waste\" to the enemy in the next loop. Nuka chants in Voidtongue and shoots Gelbstein, then himself.\n\n**[Reset Loop 17 -> Start Loop 18]**\n\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Training Yard):** Nuka Balthasar reports for duty to Gelbstein, appearing calmer but internally recalling the Loop 17 torture/deaths. Gelbstein notes familiarity. Nuka immediately reveals knowledge of perimeter/comm sabotage (\"walls have ears\"). Gelbstein probes. Nuka shows the loop device ('18'), explains the Sandman directive, his mission, the loops, and the April 20X2 deadline. He warns against using official channels due to surveillance. Gelbstein tests Nuka by asking for classified codes (Il-Kwon's comms, Gamma armory), which Nuka provides correctly. Nuka advises a covert sweep and blending in.\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Gelbstein's Quarters):** Gelbstein summons Scorpion, Vega, Jian, Reyes. He discreetly briefs them on the situation: Nuka's claims, Sandman, sabotage evidence, potential internal conspiracy.\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Bug Discovery):** Nuka bursts into Gelbstein's quarters, warns them to stop talking, and stabs the desk, revealing a hidden military-grade listening device. This confirms Nuka's warnings about compromised channels.\n*   **Day 1, Evening (Oak Tree Briefing):** The core group (Gelbstein, Nuka, Scorpion, Vega, Jian, Reyes) meets secretly in an oak tree. Nuka shares intel on likely bug locations and warns about possible Bhiya contract operatives/insiders knowing their plans due to loop knowledge. Nuka suggests focusing on perfecting basic drills to become unpredictable. Gelbstein agrees, assigning tasks: Vega to develop countermeasures, Scorpion to assist drilling, Jian on overwatch.\n*   **Night (Perimeter/Base Sweep):** The core team conducts another covert sweep. They find more bugs in multiple locations (armory, barracks). Gelbstein discovers a bug in his *own* comms radio (Penumbra insignia). They confirm pervasive surveillance reaching personal gear. Nuka stresses need to rotate meeting spots.\n*   **(Implied Passage of Time - Approx. 3 Weeks):** Gelbstein intensifies Alpha Team training, focusing on fundamentals and incorporating subtle counter-surveillance drills. Nuka maintains cover, feigning incompetence while secretly feeding intel to Gelbstein during discreet meetings (new Bhiya marks found, Marsh's suspicious patrol changes discussed, \"owls\" codename overheard). Gelbstein provides Nuka with encrypted comms chip and scanner.\n*   **Loop 18 End (Torture by Penumbra / G1 Agents):** G1 mission, Gelbstein leads the team through Southwest underground tunnel. They find a control room by the abandoned sewer structure and a dead-end tunnel with countless Bhiya sigils. The team push forward and infiltrate the building. Everyone died one by one climbing to the fifth floor. Nuka and Gelbstein got captured then tortured for two weeks, asked for information about 'Bhiya's sigil' for an unrelated operation. Nuka learns that Peterson is revealed to be a traitor who was serving under Ramirez' truce with Penumbra, effectively crossing Falkos and Sandman. However, Peterson removes memories of himself from Nuka using Bhiya's sigil to avoid his own detection next loop, then killing Gelbstein and Nuka.\n\n**[Reset Loop 18 -> Start Loop 19]**\n* Nuka decides the next plan is to get rid of all Bhi'e / Bhiya users powers by erasing their relics.\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Barracks):** Nuka awakens, recalling the Loop 18 ambush/deaths, feeling effects of memory redaction concerning specific details from the Loop 17/18 torture. Determines North West route near G1 is compromised/a trap.\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Training Yard):** Nuka reports, emotionally unstable. Gelbstein notes familiarity. During standard questioning, Nuka immediately reveals knowledge of internal vulnerabilities (\"walls have ears\") and briefly leans against Gelbstein. Gelbstein orders him to stand down but asks for intel through proper channels (himself). Nuka gives non-committal response.\n*   **Day 1, Later:** Gelbstein tasks Vega with discreet background checks on Alpha Team (focusing on new recruits/Nuka). Scorpion reports Recruit Peterson missing without leave. This corroborates Nuka's (unspoken this loop) warnings about internal threats.\n*   **Day 1, Firing Range:** Gelbstein confronts Nuka about Peterson's disappearance. Nuka confirms connection but states \"Not here.\" They agree to meet secretly at the south perimeter fence after lights out.\n*   **Night (Perimeter Fence):** They meet. Nuka shows loop counter ('19'), fully explains Sandman Directive, loops, anchor status, G1 failures, Loop 18 torture/death/relic mention. Gelbstein accepts the truth of Nuka's situation. Nuka states the enemy (Bhiya/Penumbra) seems to know about loop variations and actively manipulates them. Gelbstein commits to working with Nuka, asks for all remembered intel.\n*   **(Implied Passage of Time - Approx. 3 Weeks):** Heightened tension. Drills focus on basics, counter-surveillance. Nuka feeds intel discreetly. Gelbstein incorporates it. Team becomes aware of Nuka's unusual skills/predictions. Bhiya marks continue to appear and be disrupted.\n*   **Sparring Incident (Training Yard):** Nuka spars aggressively with Reyes, loses control during a flashback triggered by proximity/combat stress, almost lethally injures Reyes. Speaks Voidtongue. Gelbstein intervenes.\n*   **Medical Annex:** Reyes helps Nuka to medbay. Gelbstein follows. Nuka has a severe breakdown, triggered by seeing another Bhiya mark (on a vase). References Gelbstein's death/torture in Loop 18. Gelbstein grounds him, comforts him, extracts actionable G1 intel (walker locations, booby traps, sigil disruption necessity). Nuka confirms North East exit failure, suggesting North West as untried variable. Gelbstein accepts the new G1 plan. They check perimeter again, find more marks. Gelbstein acknowledges Nuka as his 'anchor'.\n*   **Night before G1 Mission (Barracks/Admin Annex):** Nuka, driven by need for concrete proof/intel, slips out. Checks Marsh's office (finds Owl file map, `ASSET ZERO`/`G1 TRIGGER` message). Hears Scorpion talking with Gelbstein in Gelbstein's office, avoids contact. Encounters/neutralizes assassin (Marsh's division) outside Gelbstein's office. Alerts Gelbstein.\n*   **Gelbstein's Office:** Gelbstein/Scorpion find Nuka with unconscious guard. Nuka shows `ASSET ZERO` message. Vega calls via phone, reports unmarked jeeps with Marsh's codes at south gate (not Falkos personnel). Nuka identifies them as escort for Bhiya relic. Gelbstein decides on 3-man intercept team (himself, Nuka, Scorpion).\n*   **Loop 19 End (Car Chase/Crash):** Gelbstein, Nuka, Scorpion pursue relic escort in jeep. Chase leads through Tanumbetty Museum area, onto interstate road. Ambushed by three black vans. Jeep tires shot out. Jeep crashes off cliff near interstate. Scorpion killed on impact. Gelbstein fatally wounded/shot by unseen figure. Nuka resets.\n\n**[Reset Loop 20]**\n\n*   **Day 1, Early Morning (Barracks):** Nuka awakens, remembering Loop 19 crash/deaths. He realizes the threat is internal. Infiltrates Griffin's office, learns of \"Operation Quadrant,\" the \"Quadrant Lute\" relic, G1 mission as a decoy, and a self-redacting note; memorizes info.\n*   **Day 1, Pre-Dawn (Admin Annex):** Nuka avoids Marsh's office, breaks into Griffin's (Intel Head) office. Finds classified Owl file. Discovers reports detailing surveillance on Gelbstein (`ASSET ZERO`), Alpha Team. Learns about `OPERATION QUADRANT`, `THE QUADRANT LUTE` relic, its function (powering Bhiya espionage/transactions), links to a pocket realm/gateway near Lake Sahaal, and energy signatures near old Tanumbetty ruins. Realizes G1 is misdirection. Discovers self-redaction trigger on file (`T-10`), commits intel to memory. Plans solo run to find relic/disrupt Bhiya. Returns to barracks.\n*   **Day 1, Morning (Barracks):** Barracks wake up. Drills begin. Nuka blends in, plans escape/solo mission. Before leaving, Nuka seeks out Vega in tech lab for an \"off the books\" favor.\n* Nuka prepares a blood-activated letter for Gelbstein, tests encryption with Vega, then delivers it during roll call with warnings before leaving Falkos without a trace.\n* Gelbstein deciphers the letter with his blood, learning vital intel (Quadrant, Sandman directive, G1 trap, Loop Counter). Destroys Bhiya listening sigils in command tent with Vega and Scorpion.\n* Day 2 (All-day): Nuka begins a solo mission near the relic's location outside Falkos.\n* Day 2 (Daytime): Gelbstein finds the groundskeeper missing near sigil-marked shed. Vega confirms deliberate rifle sabotage (filed pins) in armory.\n* Alpha Team Drills & New Threat (Daytime/Evening): Gelbstein briefs Alpha, enforces strict weapon checks. New, precise \"Penumbra\" sigils discovered inside rifles causing malfunctions, revealing a second internal enemy.\n* Night Actions: Gelbstein secures weapon audit clearance from Il-Kwon. Checks personal locker for promised Loop Counter (absent). Remains vigilant, preparing for the internal threat.\n\n**[Reset Loop 21]**\n\n* Nuka immediately starts off the loop by running away from Falkos, focusing his efforts on hunting down the relic and subduing all Bhiya operators' powers without directly engaging with them.\n* Nuka **evades** Sandman operatives near Lake Sahaal, **securing** a 72-hour window to retrieve the relic.\n* He **bargains** with Bhiya’s spirit, **proving** loyalty only to Gelbstein’s survival in exchange for the relic.\n* A blood pact **activates** the relic, **fracturing** space and **pulling** Nuka into Bhiya’s realm.\n* Nuka strikes a deal with Bhiya, **exchanging** for the Lute relic and his own early death in the loop.\n* Bhiya **accepts** the Lute relic's return, therefore erasing it from reality. She then **grants** a teleport beacon before Nuka **dies** in exchange for performing this temporary deal; **nullifying** all espionage functions of Bhiya operators.\n* The loop **resumes** with Nuka already dead.\n* Gelbstein **trains** Alpha Team rigorously, **preparing** for the G1 mission.\n* Bhiya **teleports** the loop device to Gelbstein’s office; its display **shifts** between \"20\" loops and the blinking Labarum sigil, signifying Nuka's soul is on-hold until the loop requirement is fulfilled (waiting for Gelbstein to die).\n* During G1, Alpha Team **fights** effectively without sigil interference, **exposing** Peterson’s sabotage early.\n* The mission **succeeds** flawlessly—zero casualties, extraction clean—**breaking** the loop’s usual failure pattern.\n* Falkos HQ descends into administrative chaos as Bhiya’s sigil network **collapses**, **crippling** hidden coordination among traitors.\n* Weeks later, Mission 2 **becomes** a fatal ambush on Charlie-4 grid, with signals jammed and no reinforcements.\n* Gelbstein **triggers** the loop device with his own death, therefore **ending** loop 20 and **restarting** as loop 22.",

It functions as a cultural and trade exchange hub.\n\nTantri-Kawa: The current capital of Naseya, Tantri-Kawa houses numerous industrial complexes, energy plants, and high-security research facilities, making it the nation's technological core.\n\nKasaepo: A large island in the far east of Naseya, furthest from the capital. Kasaepo shares a land border with Platinn and is frequently embroiled in territorial disputes over gold mines and other natural resources.\n\nKulu: A small archipelago known for its spice and herb cultivation, as well as castor production. Kulu exports much of Naseya’s traditional medicine and flavor goods.\n\nGedwey and Ganirc: Two neighboring islands that are considered the poorest provinces in Naseya, often receiving prisoners and victims of political exile. They are characterized by rural villages, subsistence farming, and local craftsmanship. \n\nDiwa: A neighboring island to Pasai and a pioneer in advanced fishery practices.

Has only two buttons and an analog LED screen.\n- First button is a blood register, with a serrated blade edge. One lower button triggers the next loop.\n-  Does not grant magical powers such as teleportation, revival, or espionage. Powers only come from contracts with Labarum deities.\n- Does not have a sound or vibrate feature.\n-  The device's LED only has one number, which indicates the current active loop. For example, if Nuka is in Loop 36, then the device will solely display 36.\n- When a timeloop protocol is about to be activated, the LED glows red instead of green, and the number morphs into the Labarum sigil.\n- Time loop device is a tether for the operator's soul and must not be destroyed, otherwise revival of the operator won't be possible.\n- Time loop button remains locked and can't be pressed until all requirements are met. First, Gelbstein must be fatally wounded or dead. Second, Nuka's blood is already on the serrated button. \n- Nuka, or any operator, CANNOT destroy their own device by any means. The device is impenetrable to its owner's physical attacks. It must be done by the contract anchor or by an enemy.\n- It's possible for Nuka to die before Gelbstein. In such case, Gelbstein can use the device once he obtains a fatal injury, whether self-inflicted or not, and then press the button in Nuka's stead.",
